We thus model what is traditionally termed the nonlinear viscoelastic behavior as an elastic-inelastic transition, where the energetically distributed nature of inelastic events and their evolution with straining is taken into account. The thermoreversible nature of inelastic deformation is modeled by invoking the notion of strain energy stored by localized inelastic shear transformations. The model results are compared to experimental data for constant true strain rate uniaxial compression tests (nonmonotonic) at different rates and temperatures; its predictive capabilities are further tested by comparison with compressive creep tests at different stress levels and temperatures.},

The final goal is to get an accurate, efficient and robust numerical model, allowing the numerical simulation of solidification processes in the metal casting industry. Some of the current issues addressed in the paper are the following. A fractional step method arising from an operator split of the governing differential equations has been used to solve the nonlinear coupled system of equations, leading to a staggered product formula solution algorithm. Nonlinear stability issues are discussed and isentropic and isothermal operator splits are formulated. Within the isentropic split, a strong operator split design constraint is introduced, by requiring that the elastic and plastic entropy, as well as the phase-change induced elastic entropy due to the latent heat, remain fixed in the mechanical problem. The formulation of the model has been consistently derived within a thermodynamic framework. The constitutive behavior has been defined by a thermoelastoplastic free energy function, including a thermal multiphase change contribution. Plastic response has been modeled by a J2 temperature dependent model, including plastic hardening and thermal softening. A brief summary of the thermomechanical frictional contact model is included. The numerical model has been implemented into the computational Finite Element code COMET developed by the authors. A numerical assessment of the isentropic and isothermal operator splits, regarding the nonlinear stability behavior, has been performed for weakly and strongly coupled thermomechanical problems. Numerical simulations of solidification processes show the performance of the computational model developed.},

Following the transition from the local to the finite element level the numerical solution of the equations governing the coupled thermomechanical problem for the discretised body undergoing finite inelastic deformations is discussed. A number of applications conclude the paper. First a purely thermal problem is investigated which is followed by the study of various physical effects on the thermomechanical response of an expanding hollow cylinder assuming plastic and viscoplastic inelastic properties of the material. Two examples taken from the metal forming practice - the heading of a steel bolt and the extrusion of an aluminium billet - are treated under the aspect of thermomechanical coupling.

The model is based on a multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient in elastic and plastic parts, together with an additive elastoplastic decomposition of the fluid content. The final relations describing the evolution of the different fields are then obtained in the thermodynamic framework furnished by the principle of maximum plastic dissipation. The particular case of an associated Drucker-Prager model in effective stresses is considered as a model example. A complete characterization of the dissipative structure of the problem of evolution is described through the derivation of an a priori stability estimate. We describe in detail the finite element implementation of the model in the context of staggered algorithms for the solution of the physically coupled problem. Finally, we present representative numerical simulations to illustrate the features of the proposed models. In particular, the case of strain localization in globally undrained conditions is studied in the proposed framework.},

This class of methods was first introduced by the authors (in the general context of thermoplasticity) in the USCM held at Chicago, July 1991, and in the IUTAM symposium held at Hannover, Germany, September 1991 The proposed schemes are fractional step methods associated with a two phase operator split of the full non-linear system of thermoelasticity into an adiabatic elastodynamics phase, followed by a heat conduction phase at fixed configuration. This operator split is shown to inherit the contractivity property of the full problem of evolution, thus leading to unconditionally B-stable product formula algorithms. In sharp contrast with this stability result, traditional staggered algorithms based on an isothermal mechanical phase followed by a heat conduction phase with an effective heat source are shown to lead, at best, to conditionally stable schemes. It is further shown that the actual implementation of these two classes of schemes is essentially identical. The numerical simulations presented include both dynamic and quasi-static problems and are shown to closely replicate the stability estimates and non-linear stability results derived for these two classes of staggered schemes.},

These results are shown to hold for general models of multiplicative plasticity that include, as a particular case, the single-crystal model. The proposed product formula algorithm is designed via an entropy based operator split that yields one of the first known staggered algorithms that retains the property of nonlinear unconditional stability. The scheme employs an isentropic step, in which the total entropy is held constant, followed by a heat conduction step (with nonlinear source) at fixed configuration. The nonlinear stability analysis shows that the proposed staggered scheme inherits the a priori energy estimate for the continuum problem, regardless of the size of the time-step. In sharp contrast with these results, it is shown that widely used staggered methods employing an isothermal step followed by a heat conduction problem can be at most only conditionally stable. The excellent performance of the methodology is illustrated in representative numerical simulations.},

  abstract = {The thermally coupled incompressible inductionless magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) problem models the flow of an electrically charged fluid under the influence of an external electromagnetic field with thermal coupling. This system of partial differential equations is strongly coupled and highly nonlinear for real cases of interest. Therefore, fully implicit time integration schemes are very desirable in order to capture the different physical scales of the problem at hand. However, solving the multiphysics linear systems of equations resulting from such algorithms is a very challenging task which requires efficient and scalable preconditioners. In this work, a new family of recursive block LU preconditioners is designed and tested for solving the thermally coupled inductionless MHD equations. These preconditioners are obtained after splitting the fully coupled matrix into one-physics problems for every variable (velocity, pressure, current density, electric potential and temperature) that can be optimally solved, e.g., using preconditioned domain decomposition algorithms. The main idea is to arrange the original matrix into an (arbitrary) 2\texttimes 2 block matrix, and consider an LU preconditioner obtained by approximating the corresponding Schur complement. For every one of the diagonal blocks in the LU preconditioner, if it involves more than one type of unknowns, we proceed the same way in a recursive fashion. This approach is stated in an abstract way, and can be straightforwardly applied to other multiphysics problems. Further, we precisely explain a flexible and general software design for the code implementation of this type of preconditioners.},

The high-speed compressible fluids are solved using standard finite volume methods. The fluids are fully coupled to general structures that can undergo highly non-linear response due to large deformations, inelasticity, contact and temperature. Particular focus is given on the scheme used to couple the fluid media with the structures. The fluids can also be modelled as low-speed compressible or slightly compressible media, which are important models in engineering practice.

  abstract = {A mathematical model for finite strain elastoplastic consolidation of fully saturated soil media is implemented into a finite element program. The algorithmic treatment of finite strain elastoplasticity for the solid phase is based on multiplicative decomposition and is coupled with the algorithm for fluid flow via the Kirchhoff pore water pressure. A two-field mixed finite element formulation is employed in which the nodal solid displacements and the nodal pore water pressures are coupled via the linear momentum and mass balance equations. The constitutive model for the solid phase is represented by modified Cam\textemdash Clay theory formulated in the Kirchhoff principal stress space, and return mapping is carried out in the strain space defined by the invariants of the elastic logarithmic principal stretches. The constitutive model for fluid flow is represented by a generalized Darcy's law formulated with respect to the current configuration. The finite element model is fully amenable to exact linearization. Numerical examples with and without finite deformation effects are presented to demonstrate the impact of geometric nonlinearity on the predicted responses. The paper concludes with an assessment of the performance of the finite element consolidation model with respect to accuracy and numerical stability.},

The application that we have in mind is FSI simulation for blood flow in large human arteries, but the discussion applies as well to several FSI problems in which an incompressible fluid interacts with a thin elastic structure. To carry out the mathematical analysis, we consider a simplified model representing the interaction between a potential fluid and a linear elastic thin tube. Despite its simplicity, this model reproduces propagation phenomena and takes into account the added-mass effect of the fluid on the structure, which is known to be source of numerical difficulties. This allows to draw conclusions that apply to more realistic problems, as well.},

  abstract = {This work describes the formulation adopted for the numerical simulation of the friction stir welding (FSW) process. FSW is a solid-state joining process (the metal is not melted during the process) devised for applications where the original metallurgical characteristics must be retained. This process is primarily used on aluminum alloys, and most often on large pieces which cannot be easily heat treated to recover temper characteristics. Heat is either induced by the friction between the tool shoulder and the work pieces or generated by the mechanical mixing (stirring and forging) process without reaching the melting point (solid-state process). To simulate this kind of welding process, a fully coupled thermo-mechanical solution is adopted. A sliding mesh, rotating together with the pin (ALE formulation), is used to avoid the extremely large distortions of the mesh around the tool in the so called stirring zone while the rest of the mesh of the sheet is fixed (Eulerian formulation). The orthogonal subgrid scale (OSS) technique is used to stabilize the mixed velocity\textendash pressure formulation adopted to solve the Stokes problem. This stabilized formulation can deal with the incompressible behavior of the material allowing for equal linear interpolation for both the velocity and the pressure fields. The material behavior is characterized either by Norton\textendash Hoff or Sheppard\textendash Wright rigid thermo-visco-plastic constitutive models. Both the frictional heating due to the contact interaction between the surface of the tool and the sheet, and the heat induced by the visco-plastic dissipation of the stirring material have been taken into account. Heat convection and heat radiation models are used to dissipate the heat through the boundaries. Both the streamline-upwind/Petrov\textendash Galerkin (SUPG) formulation and the OSS stabilization technique have been implemented to stabilize the convective term in the balance of energy equation. The numerical simulations presented are intended to show the accuracy of the proposed methodology and its capability to study real FSW processes where a non-circular pin is often used.},

Structural and thermal fields are independently discretised via finite elements. The resulting system of equations is solved via a monolithic thermo-structure interaction scheme, which is constructed by a block Gauss\textendash Seidel preconditioner in combination with algebraic multigrid methods. The proposed method is tested for four numerical examples, the second Danilovskaya problem, a simplified rocket nozzle configuration, an internally loaded hollow sphere, and a fully three-dimensional nozzle configuration of a subscale thrust chamber. Good agreement of the numerical results with results from the literature is observed. Furthermore, it is shown that the monolithic solution algorithm can handle the complete range of the parameter spectrum, whereas partitioned algorithms are limited to a certain parameter range only. Moreover, the monolithic algorithm exhibits improved efficiency and robustness compared to partitioned algorithms. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2013 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {Fluid-structure interaction refers to the mutual interaction between a fluid flow and a deforming structure. This phenomenon occurs due to the blood flow in our arteries and also during the inflation of a balloon. To simulate fluid-structure interaction problems, both flow equations and the structural equations have to be solved. Partitioned techniques solve the flow equations and the structural equations separately by coupling a flow solver with a structural solver. However, as the governing equations are solved separately, the stresses and displacements on the fluid-structure interface are not automatically in equilibrium. Therefore, coupling iterations between the flow solver and the structural solver have to be performed in each time step of the partitioned simulation if the interaction between the flow and the structure is strong. In this research, the stability of a simple coupling algorithm has been investigated to gain insight into the difficulties of partitioned fluid-structure interaction simulations. Furthermore, existing and more complex algorithms have been compared and several new algorithms have been developed. Most of these algorithms do not require knowledge or more modification of the internals of the flow solver and the structural solver. Finally, fluid-structure interaction problems involving free surface flow have been solved.},

The fluid flow considered is governed by the incompressible Navier\textendash Stokes equations and modelled with stabilised low order velocity\textendash pressure finite elements. The motion of the fluid domain is accounted for by an arbitrary Lagrangian\textendash Eulerian (ALE) strategy. The structure is represented by means of an appropriate standard finite element formulation. For the temporal discretisation of both fluid and solid bodies, the discrete implicit generalised-{$\alpha$} method is employed. An important aspect of the presented work is the introduction of the independent interface discretisation, which allows an efficient, modular and expandable implementation of the solution strategy. A simple data transfer strategy based on a finite element type interpolation of the interface degrees of freedom guarantees kinematic consistency and equilibrium of the stresses along the interface. The resulting strongly coupled set of non-linear equations is solved by means of a novel partitioned solution procedure, which is based on the Newton\textendash Raphson methodology and incorporates the full linearisation of the overall incremental problem. Thus, asymptotically quadratic convergence of the residuals is achieved. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the robustness and efficiency of the methodology.},

  abstract = {This paper deals with the numerical simulation of friction stir welding (FSW) processes. FSW techniques are used in many industrial applications and particularly in the aeronautic and aerospace industries, where the quality of the joining is of essential importance. The analysis is focused either at global level, considering the full component to be jointed, or locally, studying more in detail the heat affected zone (HAZ). The analysis at global (structural component) level is performed defining the problem in the Lagrangian setting while, at local level, an apropos kinematic framework which makes use of an efficient combination of Lagrangian (pin), Eulerian (metal sheet) and ALE (stirring zone) descriptions for the different computational sub-domains is introduced for the numerical modeling. As a result, the analysis can deal with complex (non-cylindrical) pin-shapes and the extremely large deformation of the material at the HAZ without requiring any remeshing or remapping tools. A fully coupled thermo-mechanical framework is proposed for the computational modeling of the FSW processes proposed both at local and global level. A staggered algorithm based on an isothermal fractional step method is introduced. To account for the isochoric behavior of the material when the temperature range is close to the melting point or due to the predominant deviatoric deformations induced by the visco-plastic response, a mixed finite element technology is introduced. The Variational Multi Scale method is used to circumvent the LBB stability condition allowing the use of linear/linear P1/P1 interpolations for displacement (or velocity, ALE/Eulerian formulation) and pressure fields, respectively. The same stabilization strategy is adopted to tackle the instabilities of the temperature field, inherent characteristic of convective dominated problems (thermal analysis in ALE/Eulerian kinematic framework). At global level, the material behavior is characterized by a thermo\textendash elasto\textendash viscoplastic constitutive model. The analysis at local level is characterized by a rigid thermo\textendash visco-plastic constitutive model. Different thermally coupled (non-Newtonian) fluid-like models as Norton\textendash Hoff, Carreau or Sheppard\textendash Wright, among others are tested. To better understand the material flow pattern in the stirring zone, a (Lagrangian based) particle tracing is carried out while post-processing FSW results. A coupling strategy between the analysis of the process zone nearby the pin-tool (local level analysis) and the simulation carried out for the entire structure to be welded (global level analysis) is implemented to accurately predict the temperature histories and, thereby, the residual stresses in FSW.},

These include physics-based methods, such as SIMPLE, and purely algebraic preconditioners based on the approximation of the Schur complement. All these techniques can be represented as approximate block factorization (ABF) type preconditioners. The goal is to decompose the application of the preconditioner into simplified sub-systems in which scalable multi-level type solvers can be applied. In this paper we develop a taxonomy of these ideas based on an adaptation of a generalized approximate factorization of the Navier\textendash Stokes system first presented in [A. Quarteroni, F. Saleri, A. Veneziani, Factorization methods for the numerical approximation of Navier\textendash Stokes equations, Computational Methods in Applied Mechanical Engineering 188 (2000) 505\textendash 526]. This taxonomy illuminates the similarities and differences among these preconditioners and the central role played by efficient approximation of certain Schur complement operators. We then present a parallel computational study that examines the performance of these methods and compares them to an additive Schwarz domain decomposition (DD) algorithm. Results are presented for two and three-dimensional steady state problems for enclosed domains and inflow/outflow systems on both structured and unstructured meshes. The numerical experiments are performed using MPSalsa, a stabilized finite element code.},

The final state of residual stresses in a workpiece depends on its material as well as the cutting-tool configuration such as tool geometry/coating, cooling and wear conditions, and process parameters including the cutting speed, depth-of-cut and feed-rate. However, there have been disagreements in some literatures regarding influences of the above-mentioned factors on residual stresses due to different cutting conditions, tool parameters and workpiece materials used in the specific investigations. This review paper categorizes different methods in experimental, numerical and analytical approaches employed for determining induced residual stresses and their relationships with cutting conditions in a turning process.

Using rigorous ALE extensions of the two-stage explicit Runge\textendash Kutta and three-point backward difference methods for the fluid, and in both cases the explicit central difference scheme for the structure, second-order time-accuracy is achieved for the coupled explicit\textendash explicit and implicit\textendash explicit fluid\textendash structure time-integration methods, respectively, via suitable predictors and careful stagings of the computational steps. The robustness of both methods and their proven second-order time-accuracy are verified for sample application problems. Their potential for the solution of highly non-linear fluid\textendash structure interaction problems is demonstrated and validated with the simulation of the dynamic collapse of a cylindrical shell submerged in water. The obtained numerical results demonstrate that, even for fluid\textendash structure applications with strong added mass effects, a carefully designed staggered and subiteration-free time-integrator can achieve numerical stability and robustness with respect to the slenderness of the structure, as long as the fluid is justifiably modeled as a compressible medium.

  abstract = {For various engineering applications, the analysis and prediction of damage onset and propagation within ductile materials under thermo-mechanical loading conditions play a crucial role. However, finite element modeling of the influence of the temperature on plastic flow and damage evolution and the back-coupling of theses dissipative processes on the temperature field remains a challenging task, until today. To this end, a thermo-mechanically coupled two-surface damage-plasticity theory is derived in a thermodynamically consistent manner for large deformations. It can be considered as the thermo-mechanically coupled extension of a corresponding isothermal model, which was proposed recently by Brepols et~al. (2020). In this novel theory, the heat generation associated with thermo-elastic coupling and irreversible processes (i.e. damage and plasticity) is derived from the first law of thermodynamics. To overcome the mesh-dependence of conventional local damage models, a gradient-extension based on the micromorphic approach of Forest (2009, 2016) is employed. Besides the theoretical development, the algorithmic implementation into finite elements is discussed, including the computation of the required tangent operators via automatic differentiation. Finally, the fully coupled multi-physical formulation is verified regarding mesh-insensitive predictions of e.g. strain localization, local heat accumulation, material and thermal-softening, as well as crack propagation and back-coupling effects on the temperature field. Quantitative and qualitative comparisons of the model's predictions to experimental data reveal the promising potential of the numerically robust and flexible theory.},

  abstract = {Coupled-field dynamic problems in mechanics have been traditionally solved by treating the entire system as one computational entity. More recently, increasing attention has been directed to an alternative approach; partition the governing equations into subsystems, which are treated by subsystem analyzers. The selection of the subsystems may be based on weak-coupling considerations, widely different time response characteristics, isolation of nonlinear effects, or more pragmatic reasons such as the availability of analyzer software. In a staggered solution procedure the solution state of the coupled system is advanced by sequentially executing the subsystem analyzers. Subsystem coupling terms are accounted for by temporal extrapolation techniques. This paper focuses on the formulation and computer implementation of staggered solution procedures for two-field problems governed by semidiscrete second-order coupled differential equations. Such equations find application in the modeling of structure-fluid, structure-soil and structure-structure interaction. Following an introductory description of candidate problems and general solution strategies, direct time integration methods are formulated and applied to the coupled system. Staggered solution procedures are constructed through two alternative approaches which are based upon partitioning at the difference and differential equation level, respectively. Characteristic equations that govern the stability of the resulting implementations are derived, and the selection of stable extrapolators discussed. Finally, possible extensions of staggered solution procedures to coupled-field static and eigenvalue problems are suggested.},

  doi = {10.18419/OPUS-270},
  abstract = {Various multifield problems and among them fluid-structure interaction applications arise in nearly all fields of engineering. The present work contributes to the development of a stable and robust approach for the numerical simulation of fluid-structure interaction problems. In particular two-dimensional and three-dimensional elastic structues interacting with incompressible flow are considered. The structural field is governed by the nonlinear elastodynamic equations while the dynamics of the fluid field are described by the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. Both fields are discretised by finite elements in space and finite difference methods in time. An iteratively staggered partitioned coupling procedure with relaxation is applied to obtain the overall coupled solution. This work focuses on methodological aspects and contributes to a deeper understanding of the theoretical foundations of the approach. This is necessary to ensure that the formulation is stable and offers reliable results for a wide range of parameters. In particular the flow solver formulated in an arbitrary Lagrangean Eulerian approach is considered. In addition to the classical conservation laws of mass, linear momentum and energy geometric conservation has to be considered. This is a consequence of the formulation of the flow equations with respect to a moving frame of reference. The relationship of these conservation laws and the stability of the numerical scheme is investigated and stability limits in terms of maximal time step sizes for different formulations are established. It is further shown how an unconditionally stable ALE formulation has to be constructed. Another key issue is the stabilised finite element method employed on the fluid domain. The derivation of the method from a virtual bubble approach is revisited while special attention is turned to the fact that the domain is moving. A version of the stabilisation is derived which is nearly unaffected by the motion of the frame of reference. Further the sensitivity of the stabilised formulation with respect to critical parameters such as very small time steps, steep gradients and distorted meshes is assessed. At least for higher order elements where full consistency of the formulation is assured very accurate results can be obtained on highly distorted meshes. As another main issue the coupling of fluid and structure within a partitioned scheme is considered. A first concern in this context is the exchange of proper coupling data at the interface which is crucial for the consistency of the overall scheme. Subsequently the so-called artificial added mass effect is analysed. This effect is responsible for an inherent instability of sequentially staggered coupling schemes applied to the coupling of lightweight structures and incompressible flow. It is essentially the influence of the incompressibilty which excludes the successful use of simple staggered schemes. The analysis derived in the course of this work reveals why the artificial added mass instability depends upon the mass ratio but further on the specific time discretisation used on the fluid and structural field. In particular it is shown why more accurate temporal discretisation results in an earlier onset of the instability. While the theoretical considerations are accompanied by small numerical examples highlighting particular aspects some larger applications of the method are finally presented. In nahezu allen Bereichen des Ingenieurwesens treten Mehrfeldprobleme auf, zu denen auch Fluid-Struktur-Interaktionen (FSI) zu zahlen sind. Diese Arbeit tragt zur Entwicklung eines stabilen und robusten numerischen Verfahrens zur Losung solcher FSI-Probleme bei. Hier werden speziell zwei- und dreidimensionale Strukturen betrachtet, die in Wechselwirkung mit inkompressiblen Flussigkeiten treten. Dabei ist das Strukturverhalten durch die nichtlinearen Gleichungen der Elastodynamik bestimmt. Die Dynamik des Fluids wird durch die inkompressiblen Navier-Stokes-Gleichungen beschrieben. Beide Felder werden mit Hilfe finiter Elemente im Raum und mittels Differenzenverfahren in der Zeit diskretisiert. Um das gekoppelte Problem zu losen, kommt ein iterativ gestaffeltes partitioniertes Kopplungsverfahren mit Relaxation zum Einsatz. Der Schwerpunkt dieser Arbeit liegt auf methodischen Aspekten. Insbesondere sollen die theoretischen Grundlagen des numerischen Verfahrens verbessert werden. Dabei ist das Ziel sicherzustellen, das das Verfahren stabil lauft und fur einen weiten Parameterbereich Ergebnisse von verlaslicher Genauigkeit liefert. Besondere Aufmerksamkeit gilt dem Fluidloser, der in "Arbitrary Lagrangean Eulerian" (ALE) Betrachtungsweise formuliert ist. Das Verhalten des Fluids wird also in Bezug auf ein bewegtes Koordinatensystem beschrieben. Daher gilt es hier, neben den klassischen Erhaltungssatzen fur Masse, Impuls und Energie auch die geometrische Erhalung zu beachten. Der Zusammenhang zwischen den verschiedenen Erhaltungssatzen und der Stabilitat des numerischen Verfahrens wird untersucht und es konnen Stabilitatsgrenzen in Form von maximalen Zeitschrittweiten fur verschiedene Verfahren angegeben werden. Weiterhin kann gezeigt werden, wie ein unbedingt stabiles ALE Verfahren formuliert werden mus . Ein nachstes Schwerpunktthema ist das stabilisierte Finite-Element-Verfahren auf dem bewegten Gebiet. Es wird eine Version des Stabilisierungsverfahrens hergeleitet, deren Stabilitat von der Netzbewegung nahezu unberuhrt bleibt. Weitere Untersuchungen betreffen die Empfindlichkeit des Verfahrens in Bezug auf kritische Parameter wie sehr kleine Zeitschritte, steile Gradienten oder auch stark verzerrte Netze. Fur Elemente hoherer Ordnung ist das stabilisierte Verfahren vollstandig konsistent. Es wird gezeigt, das mit solchen Elementen auch auf deutlich verzerrten Nezten sehr genaue Ergebnisse erzielt werden konnen. Besonderes Augenmerk wird auch auf die Fluid-Struktur-Kopplung im Rahmen partitionierter Verfahren gelegt. In diesem Zusammenhang betrifft eine erste Frage den Austausch genauer und methodisch konsistenter Kopplungsinformation an der Grenzflache zwischen Fluid und Struktur. Weiterhin wird der sogenannte "artificial added mass effect" analysiert. Dieser Effekt bezeichnet die inherente Instabilitat, die bei sequentiell gestaffelten Verfahren auftritt, wenn leichte Strukturen mit inkompressiblen Fluiden gekoppelt werden. Dabei ist letztendlich die Inkompressibilitat dafur verantwortlich, das einfache sequentiell gestaffelte Verfahren nicht erfolgreich verwendet werden konnen. Die mathematische Analyse, die im Rahmen dieser Arbeit vorgenommen wird, zeigt, warum die Instabilitat nicht nur vom Massenverhaltnis der beteiligten Kontinua, sondern auch von der Zeitdiskretisierung der Felder abhangt. Es wird deutlich, warum genauere zeitliche Diskretisierungsansatze ein fruheres Eintreten der Instabilitat zur Folge haben. Die theoretischen Ergebnisse werden durch begleitende kleine Beispielrechnungen veranschaulicht. Einige grosere Anwendungen des Verfahrens werden am Schlus der Arbeit prasentiert.},

In this contribution, we concentrate on the strong coupling fluid\textendash structure interaction by means of monolithic solution schemes. Therein, a Newton\textendash Krylov method is applied to the monolithic set of nonlinear equations. Such schemes require good preconditioning to be efficient. We propose two preconditioners that apply algebraic multigrid techniques to the entire fluid\textendash structure interaction system of equations. The first is based on a standard block Gauss\textendash Seidel approach, where approximate inverses of the individual field blocks are based on a algebraic multigrid hierarchy tailored for the type of the underlying physical problem. The second is based on a monolithic coarsening scheme for the coupled system that makes use of prolongation and restriction projections constructed for the individual fields. The resulting nonsymmetric monolithic algebraic multigrid method therefore involves coupling of the fields on coarse approximations to the problem yielding significantly enhanced performance.

  abstract = {Abstract We present a method with domain decomposition to solve time-dependent non-linear problems. This method enables arbitrary numeric schemes of the Newmark family to be coupled with different time steps in each subdomain: this coupling is achieved by prescribing continuity of velocities at the interface. We are more specifically interested in the coupling of implicit/explicit numeric schemes taking into account material and geometric non-linearities. The interfaces are modelled using a dual Schur formulation where the Lagrange multipliers represent the interfacial forces. Unlike the continuous formulation, the discretized formulation of the dynamic problem is unable to verify simultaneously the continuity of displacements, velocities and accelerations at the interfaces. We show that, within the framework of the Newmark family of numeric schemes, continuity of velocities at the interfaces enables the definition of an algorithm which is stable for all cases envisaged. To prove this stability, we use an energy method, i.e. a global method over the whole time interval, in order to verify the algorithms properties. Then, we propose to extend this to non-linear situations in the following cases: implicit linear/explicit non-linear, explicit non-linear/explicit non-linear and implicit non-linear/explicit non-linear. Finally, we present some examples showing the feasibility of the method. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

However, the implication of the basic postulates and the significance of the related procedure for the development of the constitutive equations is also illustrated in some detail in the context of flow of heat in a rigid solid with particular reference to the propagation of thermal waves at finite speed. More specifically, after briefly examining the nature of the basic equations of motion for a system of particles within the scope of the classical newtonian mechanics, the basic postulates of the purely mechanical theory for a continuum (including its specialization for a rigid body) is re-examined. This includes some differences from the usual procedure on the subject. Next, thermal variables are introduced and after observing a useful analogy between the thermal and mechanical variables, a discussion of a theory of heat (or a purely thermal theory) is provided which differs from the usual development in the classical thermodynamics. A detailed application of the latter development is then made to the problem of heat flow in a stationary rigid solid using several different and well-motivated constitutive equations. Special cases of these include linearized theories of the classical heat flow by conduction and of heat flow transmitted as thermal waves. The remainder of the paper is concerned with thermal mechanical theory of deformable media along with discussions of a number of related issues on the subject.},

The KDC method allows discretizing the temporal direction using relatively large time-steps, making the method very promising for dynamic simulations, particularly when high precision is desired. A multi-domain GFDM scheme is also employed where the composite material considered is decomposed into several sub-domains and, in each sub-domain, the solution is approximated by using the GFDM expansion. On the sub-domain interface, compatibility of temperatures and normal heat fluxes is imposed. The method is tested on several benchmark numerical examples and its relative merits and disadvantages are discussed.},

  abstract = {Multibody contact problems are common within the field of multiphysics simulation. Applications involving thermomechanical contact scenarios are also quite prevalent. Such problems can be challenging to solve due to the likelihood of thermal expansion affecting contact geometry which, in turn, can change the thermal behavior of the components being analyzed. This paper explores a simple model of a light water reactor nuclear fuel rod, which consists of cylindrical pellets of uranium dioxide (UO2) fuel sealed within a Zircalloy cladding tube. The tube is initially filled with helium gas, which fills the gap between the pellets and cladding tube. The accurate modeling of heat transfer across the gap between fuel pellets and the protective cladding is essential to understanding fuel performance, including cladding stress and behavior under irradiated conditions, which are factors that affect the lifetime of the fuel. The thermomechanical contact approach developed here is based on the mortar finite element method, where Lagrange multipliers are used to enforce weak continuity constraints at participating interfaces. In this formulation, the heat equation couples to linear mechanics through a thermal expansion term. Lagrange multipliers are used to formulate the continuity constraints for both heat flux and interface traction at contact interfaces. The resulting system of nonlinear algebraic equations are cast in residual form for solution of the transient problem. A Jacobian-free Newton Krylov method is used to provide for fully-coupled solution of the coupled thermal contact and heat equations.},

The performance of the preconditioner is demonstrated on a set of challenging multiphysics partial differential equation (PDE) applications: a drift-diffusion approximation for semiconductor devices; a low Mach number formulation for the simulation of coupled flow, transport and non-equilibrium chemical reactions; and a low Mach number formulation for visco-resistive magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) systems. These systems contain multiple physical mechanisms that are strongly coupled, highly nonlinear, non-symmetric and produce solutions with multiple length- and time-scales. In the context of this study the governing PDEs for these systems are discretized in space by a stabilized finite element (FE) method that collocates all unknowns at each node of the FE mesh. The algebraic multilevel preconditioner is based on an aggressive-coarsening graph-partitioning of the non-zero block structure of the Jacobian matrix. The performance of the algebraic multilevel preconditioner is compared with a standard variable overlap additive Schwarz domain decomposition preconditioner. Representative performance and parallel scaling results are presented for a set of direct-to-steady-state and fully implicit transient solutions. The performance studies include parallel weak scaling studies on up to 4096 cores and also includes the solution of systems as large as two billion unknowns carried out on 24000 cores of a Cray XT3/4. In general, the results of this study indicate that on this reasonably diverse set of challenging multiphysics applications the algebraic multilevel preconditioner performs very well.

  abstract = {Non-matching meshes and domain decomposition techniques based on Lagrange multipliers provide a flexible and efficient discretization technique for variational inequalities with interface constraints. Although mortar methods are well analyzed for variational inequalities, its application to dynamic thermo-mechanical contact problems with friction is still a field of active research. In this work, we extend the mortar approach for dynamic contact problems with Coulomb friction to the thermo-mechanical case. We focus on the discretization and on algorithmic aspects of dynamic effects such as frictional heating and thermal softening at the contact interface. More precisely, we generalize the mortar concept of dual Lagrange multipliers to non-linear Robin-type interface conditions and apply local static condensation to eliminate the heat flux. Numerical examples in the two-dimensional and the three-dimensional setting illustrate the flexibility of the discretization on non-matching meshes.},

The physical model is restricted to Biot's theory of single-phase flow and linear poroelasticity, but is sufficiently general to be extended to multiphase flow problems and inelastic behavior. The distinctive technical aspects of our approach are: (1) the space discretization of the equations. The unknown variables are the pressure, the fluid velocity, and the rock displacements. We recognize that these variables are of very different nature, and need to be discretized differently. We propose a mixed finite element space discretization, which is stable, convergent, locally mass conservative, and employs a single computational grid. To ensure stability and robustness, we perform an implicit time integration of the fluid flow equations. (2) The strategies for the solution of the coupled system. We compare different solution strategies, including the fully coupled approach, the usual (conditionally stable) iteratively coupled approach, and a less common unconditionally stable sequential scheme. We show that the latter scheme corresponds to a modified block Jacobi method, which also enjoys improved convergence properties. This computational model has been implemented in an object-oriented reservoir simulator, whose modular design allows for further extensions and enhancements. We show several representative numerical simulations that illustrate the effectiveness of the approach.},

  abstract = {Abstract We perform a stability and convergence analysis of sequential methods for coupled flow and geomechanics, in which the mechanics sub-problem is solved first. We consider slow deformations, so that inertia is negligible and the mechanical problem is governed by an elliptic equation. We use Biot's self-consistent theory to obtain the classical parabolic-type flow problem. We use a generalized midpoint rule (parameter {$\alpha$} between 0 and 1) time discretization, and consider two classical sequential methods: the drained and undrained splits. The von Neumann method provides sharp stability estimates for the linear poroelasticity problem. The drained split with backward Euler time discretization ( {$\alpha$} = 1) is conditionally stable, and its stability depends only on the coupling strength, and it is independent of time step size. The drained split with the midpoint rule ( {$\alpha$} = 0.5) is unconditionally unstable. The mixed time discretization, with {$\alpha$} = 1.0 for mechanics and {$\alpha$} = 0.5 for flow, has the same stability properties as the backward Euler scheme. The von Neumann method indicates that the undrained split is unconditionally stable when {$\alpha$} {$\geqslant$} 0.5. We extend the stability analysis to the nonlinear regime (poro-elastoplasticity) via the energy method. It is well known that the drained split does not inherit the contractivity property of the continuum problem, thereby precluding unconditional stability. For the undrained split we show that it is B-stable (therefore unconditionally stable at the algorithmic level) when {$\alpha$} {$\geqslant$} 0.5. We also analyze convergence of the drained and undrained splits, and derive the a priori error estimates from matrix algebra and spectral analysis. We show that the drained split with a fixed number of iterations is not convergent even when it is stable. The undrained split with a fixed number of iterations is convergent for a compressible system (i.e., finite Biot modulus). For a nearly-incompressible system (i.e., very large Biot modulus), the undrained split loses first-order accuracy, and becomes non-convergent in time. We also study the rate of convergence of both splits when they are used in a fully-iterated sequential scheme. When the medium permeability is high or the time step size is large, which corresponds to a high diffusion of pressure, the error amplification of the drained split is lower and therefore converges faster than the undrained split. The situation is reversed in the case of low permeability and small time step size. We provide numerical experiments supporting all the stability and convergence estimates of the drained and undrained splits, in the linear and nonlinear regimes. We also show that our spatial discretization (finite volumes for flow and finite elements for mechanics) removes the well-documented spurious instability in consolidation problems at early times.},

We employ the von Neumann and energy methods for linear and nonlinear problems, respectively. We consider two sequential methods with the generalized midpoint rule for tn+{$\alpha$}, where {$\alpha$} is the parameter of time discretization: namely, the fixed-strain and fixed-stress splits. The von Neumann method indicates that the fixed-strain split is only conditionally stable, and that its stability limit is a coupling strength less than unity if {$\alpha$} {$\geqslant$} 0.5. On the other hand, the fixed-stress split is unconditionally stable when {$\alpha$} {$\geqslant$} 0.5, the amplification factors of the fixed-stress split are different from those of the undrained split and are identical to the fully coupled method. Unconditional stability of the fixed-stress split is also obtained from the energy method for poroelastoplasticity. We show that the fixed-stress split is contractive and B-stable when {$\alpha$} {$\geqslant$} 0.5. We also estimate the convergence behaviors for the two sequential methods by the matrix based and spectral analyses for the backward Euler method in time. From the estimates, the fixed-strain split may not be convergent with a fixed number of iterations particularly around the stability limit even though it is stable. The fixed-stress split, however, is convergent for a fixed number of iterations, showing better accuracy than the undrained split. Even when we cannot obtain the exact local bulk modulus (or exact rock compressibility) at the flow step a priori due to complex boundary conditions or the nonlinearity of the materials, the fixed-stress split can still provide stability and convergence by an appropriate estimation of the local bulk modulus, such as the dimension-based estimation, by which the employed local bulk modulus is less stiff than the exact local bulk modulus. We provide numerical examples supporting all the estimates of stability and convergence for the fixed-strain and fixed-stress splits.},

To be able to deal with non-conforming meshes at the fluid\textendash structure interface, we propose the integration of a dual mortar method into the general FSI framework. This method has lately been used successfully to impose interface constraints in other contexts such as finite deformation contact. The main focus is set on monolithic coupling algorithms for FSI here. In these cases the dual mortar approach allows for the elimination of the additional Lagrange multiplier degrees of freedom from the global system by condensation. The resulting system matrices have the same block structure as their counterparts for the conforming case and permit the same numerical treatment. Partitioned Dirichlet\textendash Neumann coupling is also considered briefly and it is shown that the dual mortar approach permits a numerically efficient mapping between fluid and structure quantities at the interface. Numerical examples demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of the proposed method. We present results for a variety of different element formulations for the fluid and the structure field, indicating that the proposed method is not limited to any specific formulation. Furthermore, the applicability of state-of-the-art iterative solvers is considered and the convergence behavior is shown to be comparable to standard simulations with conforming discretizations at the interface.},

Highly optimized, existing solvers can thus be reused\textemdash which enhances modularity, reusability, and performance. However, depending on the problem at hand, appropriate measures must be taken to stabilize the solution process and accelerate its convergence.

Recently, the combination of thermodynamically based stability estimates and energy-momentum numerical approaches has proven to be useful in developing effective, unconditionally stable algorithms for mechanical contact/impact in the fully nonlinear regime. In this paper, these ideas are extended to coupled interface problems, by developing a new a priori stability estimate for the fully coupled thermomechanical contact problem in large deformations. The model framework encompasses inelastic heating and thermal softening within the contacting bodies, as well as frictional heating and thermal softening of the coefficient of friction on sliding interfaces. Also incorporated are pressure dependent heat transfer across these interfaces, and a fully coupled treatment of the conductive heat transfer occurring within the bodies. Use of the stability estimate to extend energy-momentum approaches to dissipative and thermally coupled phenomena is discussed, as is the development of an unconditionally stable adiabatic split of the coupled problem. The latter is shown to be useful in developing partitioned integration schemes for the coupled equations of evolution.},

  abstract = {A recent experiment confirmed that the infrared (IR) local heating method drastically reduces springback of dual-phase (DP) 980 sheets. In the experiment, only the plastic deformation zone of the sheets was locally heated using condensed IR heating. The heated sheets were then deformed by V-bending or 2D-draw bending. Although the experimental observation proved the merit of using the IR local heating to reduce springback, numerical modeling has not been reported. Numerical modeling has been required to predict springback and improve the understanding of the forming process. This paper presents a numerical modeling for V-bending and 2D-draw bending of DP 980 sheets exposed to the IR local heating with the finite element method (FEM). For describing the thermo-mechanical behavior of the DP 980 sheet, a flow stress model which includes a function of temperature and effective plastic strain was newly implemented into Euler-backward stress integration method. The numerical analysis shows that the IR local heating reduces the level of stress in the deformation zone, although it heats only the limited areas, and then it reduces the springback. The simulation also provides a support that the local heating method has an advantage of shape accuracy over the method to heat the material as a whole in V-bending. The simulated results of the springback in both V-bending and 2D-draw bending also show good predictions.},

  abstract = {A comprehensive computational framework based on the finite element method for the simulation of coupled hygro-thermo-mechanical problems in photovoltaic laminates is herein proposed. While the thermo-mechanical problem takes place in the three-dimensional space of the laminate, moisture diffusion occurs in a two-dimensional domain represented by the polymeric layers and by the vertical channel cracks in the solar cells. Therefore, a geometrical multi-scale solution strategy is pursued by solving the partial differential equations governing heat transfer and thermo-elasticity in the three-dimensional space, and the partial differential equation for moisture diffusion in the two dimensional domains. By exploiting a staggered scheme, the thermo-mechanical problem is solved first via a fully implicit solution scheme in space and time, with a specific treatment of the polymeric layers as zero-thickness interfaces whose constitutive response is governed by a novel thermo-visco-elastic cohesive zone model based on fractional calculus. Temperature and relative displacements along the domains where moisture diffusion takes place are then projected to the finite element model of diffusion, coupled with the thermo-mechanical problem by the temperature and crack opening dependent diffusion coefficient. The application of the proposed method to photovoltaic modules pinpoints two important physical aspects: (i) moisture diffusion in humidity freeze tests with a temperature dependent diffusivity is a much slower process than in the case of a constant diffusion coefficient; (ii) channel cracks through Silicon solar cells significantly enhance moisture diffusion and electric degradation, as confirmed by experimental tests.},

Thermomechanical analysis is critical for EEDs in these applications since excessive heating-induced temperature increase and stress may cause discomfort. An axisymmetric analytical thermomechanical model based on the transfer matrix method, accounting for the coupling between the Fourier heat conduction in the EED and the bio-heat transfer in human skin, the multilayer feature of human skin and the size effect of the heating component in EEDs, is established to study the thermomechanical behavior of the EED/skin system. The predictions of the temperature increase and principle stress from the analytical model agree well with those from finite element analysis (FEA). The influences of various geometric parameters and material properties of the substrate on the maximum principle stress are fully investigated to provide design guidelines for avoiding the adverse thermal effects. The thermal and mechanical comfort analyses are then performed based on the analytical model. These results establish the theoretical foundation for thermomechanical analysis of the EED/skin system.},

It has revolutionized sheet shaping for small-batch production since its inception in the 1990s, providing an economical and effective alternative to sheet stamping and pressing, which are cumbersome and expensive. However, the materials with poor overall ductility at room temperatures are difficult to be formed by conventional incremental sheet forming. Therefore, several heat-assisted incremental sheet-forming methods have been developed by researchers trying to improve the formability of such materials and overcome the low geometrical accuracy as well. The aim of this paper is to provide a state-of-the-art review on the development of heat-assisted incremental sheet forming. It is hoped that the knowledge provided in this paper can facilitate readers working in this field to obtain a comprehensive view and take a step forward for future incremental forming of hard-to-deform materials at elevated temperatures.},

In the present study, we therefore calculated mechanical AAA quantities using nonlinear finite element methods and correlated these to [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-metabolic activity in the AAA wall detected by positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT). The interplay between mechanics and FDG-metabolic activity was analyzed in terms of maximum values and the three-dimensional spatial relationship, respectively. Fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT) data sets of n = 18 AAA patients were studied. Maximum FDG-uptake (SUV max ) in the AAA wall varied from 1.32 to 4.60 (average SUV max 3.31 {$\pm$} 0.87). Maximum wall stresses and strains ranged from 10.0 to 64.0 N/cm(2) (38.2 {$\pm$} 13.8\, N/cm(2)) and from 0.190 to 0.260 (0.222 {$\pm$} 0.023), respectively. SUV max was significantly correlated to maximum wall stress and strain (SUV max to stress: r = 0.71, p = 0.0005; SUV max to strain: r = 0.66, p = 0.0013). To evaluate the three-dimensional spatial interaction between FDG-uptake and acting wall stress, element-wise correlations were performed. In all but 2 AAAs, positive element-wise correlation of FDG-uptake to wall stress was obtained, with the Pearson's correlation coefficient ranging from -0.168 to 0.738 ( 0.372 {$\pm$} 0.263). The results indicate that mechanical stresses are correlated quantitatively and spatially to FDG-uptake in the AAA wall. It is hypothesized that unphysiologically increased loading in the AAA wall triggers biological tissue reaction, such as inflammation or regenerative processes, causing elevated FDG-metabolic activity.

Nevertheless,the procedure for this strategy is divided into two phases within each increment: the prediction and the correction phases, while the interchange of information is performed on both. This allows takingadvantage of automatic time-step control techniques, previously implemented for the mechanicalproblem, which is the main feature that distinguishes it from the classical strategies. The aim of the proposed strategy is to reduce the computational cost without compromising the accuracy of the results. The new coupling strategy is validated using three numerical examples, comparing its accuracy and performance with the ones obtained with the classical (commonly employed) strategies for solving thermomechanical problems. Moreover, the influence of the time-step size on the accuracy is analysed. The results indicate that the proposed strategy presents accuracy close to the one obtained with the implicit coupling algorithm, while the computational cost is only slightly higher than the one required by the explicit strategy.},

  abstract = {We present a monolithic approach to large-deformation fluid-structure interaction (FSI) problems that allows for choosing fully implicit, single-step and single-stage time integration schemes in the structure and fluid field independently, and hence is tailored to the needs of the individual field. The independent choice of time integration schemes is achieved by temporal consistent interpolation of the interface traction. To reduce computational costs, we introduce the possibility of field specific predictors in both structure and fluid field. These predictors act on the single fields only. Possible violations of the interface coupling conditions during the predictor step are dealt with within the monolithic solution procedure. We present full details of such a generalized monolithic solution procedure, which is fully consistent in its nonconforming temporal and spatial discretization. The incorporated mortar approach allows for nonmatching spatial discretizations of the fluid and solid domain at the fluid-structure interface and is fully integrated in the resulting monolithic system of equations. The method is applied to a variety of numerical examples. Thereby, temporal convergence rates, the special role of essential boundary conditions at the fluid-structure interface, and the positive effect of predictors are demonstrated and discussed. Emphasis is put on the comparison of different time integration schemes in fluid and structure field, for what the achieved freedom of choice of time integrators is fully exploited.},

  abstract = {Numerical simulation of fluid\textendash structure interactions has typically been done using partitioned solution methods. However, partitioned methods are inherently non-conservative and generally numerically unstable. The deficiencies of partitioned methods have motivated the investigation of monolithic solution methods. Conservation is possible for monolithic methods, the conditions have recently been presented [E.H. van Brummelen, S.J. Hulshoff, R. de Borst, Energy conservation under incompatibility for fluid\textendash structure interaction problems, Comput. Methods Appl. Mech. Engrg. 192 (2003) 2727\textendash 2748]. In the present paper we investigate the relevance of maintaining conservation for a model fluid\textendash structure interaction problem, viz., the piston problem. To distinguish the effect of the error induced by the interface coupling from the fluid and structure discretization errors, we use fluid subcycling and an exact time-integration method for the structure. A comparison between conservative and non-conservative monolithic methods as well as partitioned methods is made. We show that maintaining conservation has considerable impact on the stability and accuracy of the numerical method. These results also indicate that only for a conservative monolithic scheme the improvement in accuracy over partitioned methods warrants the computational cost associated with a monolithic solution. Moreover, we illustrate the implications that particular combinations of fluid and structure discretizations can have on the conservation properties of the fluid\textendash structure interaction problem.},

In contrast to existing kinematical approaches to finite plasticity of glassy polymers, the formulation applies a plastic metric theory based on an additive split of Lagrangian Hencky-type strains into elastic and plastic parts. The analogy between the proposed formulation in the logarithmic strain space and the geometrically linear theory of plasticity, makes this constitutive framework very transparent and attractive with regard to its numerical formulation. The characteristic strain hardening of the model is derived from a polymer network model. We consider the particularly simple eight chain model, but also comment on the recently developed microsphere model. The viscoplastic flow rule in the logarithmic strain space uses structures of the free volume flow theory, which provides a highly predictive modeling capacity at the onset of viscoplastic flow. The integration of this micromechanically motivated approach into a three-dimensional computational model is a key concern of this work. We outline details of the numerical implementation of this model, including elements such as geometric pre- and post-transformations to/from the logarithmic strain space, a thermomechanical operator split algorithm consisting of an isothermal mechanical predictor followed by a heat conduction corrector and finally, the consistent linearization of the local update algorithm for the dissipative variables as well as its relationship to the global tangent operator. The performance of the proposed formulation is demonstrated by means of a spectrum of numerical examples, which we compare with our experimental findings.},

The underlying concept is the introduction of a metric transformation tensor which maps a locally defined six-dimensional plastic metric onto the metric of the current configuration. This mixed-variant tensor field provides a basis for the definition of a local isotropic hyperelastic stress response in the thermoplastic solid. Following this fundamental assumption, we derive a consistent internal variable formulation of thermoplasticity in a Lagrangian as well as a Eulerian geometric setting. On the numerical side, we discuss in detail an objective integration algorithm for the mixed-variant plastic flow rule. The special feature here is a new representation of the stress return and the algorithmic elastoplastic moduli in the eigenvalue space of the Eulerian plastic metric for plane problems. Furthermore, an algorithm for the solution of the coupled problem is formulated based on an operator split of the global field equations of thermoplasticity. The paper concludes with two representative numerical simulations of thermoplastic deformation processes.},

The development of reusable hypersonic cruise vehicles requires analysis capability that can capture the coupled, highly-nonlinear interactions between the fluid flow, structural mechanics, and structural heat transfer. This coupled analysis must also be performed over significant portions of the flight trajectory due to the long-term thermal evolution of the vehicle. The fluid and structural physics operate at significantly smaller time scales than the thermal evolution, requiring time marching that can capture the small time scales for time records that encapsulate the longer time scale of the thermal response. This leads to extreme computational times and motivates research that seeks to maximize efficiency of the time integrations for the coupled problem. The goal of this dissertation is to develop time integration procedures that significantly improve computational efficiency while also maintaining time accuracy},

The underlying equations are based on the non-linear transient heat equation, the local equilibrium conditions and the evolution equations of the internal variables. The latter describe the hardening behavior of the material. If the method of vertical lines is applied, its first step\textendash namely the spatial discretization\textendash yields a system of differential-algebraic equations (DAE-system). Here, we employ the p-version of the finite element method based on integrated Legendre polynomials. This can lead to very precise solutions in the spatial domain. In order to be accurate in the time-domain as well, stiffly accurate, diagonally-implicit Runge\textendash Kutta methods are applied to solve the DAE-system yielding a coupled system of non-linear algebraic equations. In this article, the system is solved monolithically by employing the Multilevel-Newton algorithm. Accordingly, a high-order result is obtained in the space and the time domain. The numerical concept is applied to a constitutive model of finite strain thermo-viscoelasticity. Several examples are applied to demonstrate the efficiency and applicability of the numerical scheme.

The use of the finite element method (FEM) in this regard has been especially popular because of its flexibility and the ability to quantify stress levels for a large variety of scenarios ranging from process-induced stress up to field conditions. The thermo-mechanical behaviour of the module or its components is often considered due to the link with common field failures such as cell cracks, interconnection failures, glass fracture, delamination and many others. However, the approaches used, the various inputs considered and the obtained results are highly scattered and sometimes conflicting. This work provides a structured review of the reported simulation approaches and resulting insights obtained through thermo-mechanical finite element simulations on commercial as well as novel PV module technologies. The influence and validity of various inputs such as the used material models, boundary conditions and other assumptions are discussed. Learnings and best practices can be leveraged by future simulations to expand on and accelerate the design-for-reliability capabilities of finite element models for PV modules.},

The strength of the two-way feedback between the thermal and mechanical solution fields can vary significantly depending on the problem. Contact problems exhibit a particularly high degree of two-way feedback between those fields. This paper describes and demonstrates the application of a flexible simulation environment that permits the solution of coupled physics problems using either a tightly coupled approach or a loosely coupled approach. In the tight coupling approach, Newton iterations include the coupling effects between all physics, while in the loosely coupled approach, the individual physics models are solved independently, and fixed-point iterations are performed until the coupled system is converged. These approaches are applied to simple demonstration problems and to realistic nuclear engineering applications. The demonstration problems consist of single and multi-domain thermomechanics with and without thermal and mechanical contact. Simulations of a reactor pressure vessel under pressurized thermal shock conditions and a simulation of light water reactor fuel are also presented. Problems that include thermal and mechanical contact, such as the contact between the fuel and cladding in the fuel simulation, exhibit much stronger two-way feedback between the thermal and mechanical solutions, and as a result, are better solved using a tight coupling strategy.},

Emphasis is placed on the proper numerical description of fully coupled thermomechanical response on frictional interfaces. From a theoretical standpoint, the first and second laws of thermodynamics are carefully formulated in the context of large deformations, giving rise to a numerical description of contact interaction that is consistent with these laws. Physical observations encompassed by the proposed interface description include thermal softening of frictional response, rate dependence, pressure dependent heat conduction across the interface, and heat sinks on the interfaces created by trapped wear debris. The finite element implementation of the framework is discussed and demonstrated, with numerical examples successfully describing such phenomena as fading braking torque in automobiles and the observed temperature and friction evolution at the interface between a gun barrel and a projectile passing through it. \textcopyright{} 1997 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {Heat flow across the interface of solid bodies in contact is an important aspect in several engineering applications. This work presents a finite element model for the analysis of thermal contact, which takes into account the effect of contact pressure and gap dimension in the heat flow across the interface between two bodies. Additionally, the frictional heat generation is also addressed, which is dictated by the contact forces predicted by the mechanical problem. The frictional contact problem and thermal problem are formulated in the frame of the finite element method. A new law is proposed to define the interfacial heat transfer coefficient (IHTC) as a function of the contact pressure and gap distance, enabling a smooth transition between two contact status (gap and contact). The staggered scheme used as coupling strategy to solve the thermomechanical problem is briefly presented. Four numerical examples are presented to validate the finite element model and highlight the importance of the proposed law on the predicted temperature.},

Such an implementation is herein called a staggered solution strategy. The conventional realization of this strategy is handicapped, however, by severe temporal stepsize limitations. Several stabilized formulations are introduced, which circumvent such limitations and achieve unconditional stability for certain extrapolators. It should be noted that these stabilization techniques are applicable to other interaction problems governed by similar coupled field equations.},

We present new coupling staggered procedures where momentum conservation is enforced at the interface. This is done by using a structural predictor. Continuity of structural and fluid grid displacements is not satisfied at the fluid/structure interface. However, we show on a two-degree-of-freedom aerofoil that this new type of method has many advantages, e.g. accuracy of conservation at the interface and extended stability.

We present a mathematical framework for assessing some important numerical properties of the chosen partitioned procedure, and predicting its performance for realistic applications. Our analysis framework is based on the estimation of the energy that is artificially introduced at the fluid/structure interface by the staggering process that is inherent to most partitioned solution methods. This framework also suggests alternative approaches for time-discretizing the transfer of aerodynamic data from the fluid subsystem to the structure subsystem that improves the accuracy and the stability properties of the underlying partitioned method. We apply this framework to the analysis of several partitioned procedures that have been previously proposed for the solution of nonlinear transient aeroelastic problems. Using two- and three-dimensional, transonic and supersonic, wing and panel aeroelastic applications, we validate this framework and highlight its impact on the design and selection of a staggering algorithm for the solution of coupled fluid/structure equations.},

A time\textendash space-finite element discretization of the governing equations is formulated including unilateral constraints due to contact. A staggered solution algorithm has been constructed that allows an independent spatial discretization of the coupled subproblems. A posteriori projection-based error estimators, which enforce implicitly the special boundary conditions due to thermal contact, are used to control the spatial discretization as well as the adaptive time stepping.

First, we develop the entire system of differential\textendash algebraic equations resulting from the spatially discretized principle of virtual displacements, the principle of virtual temperatures, and the evolution equations of the internal variables provided by the constitutive model. In the time-integration step this system is solved both using a fully monolithic approach based on a Backward\textendash Euler scheme in combination with the Multilevel-Newton algorithm as well as a partitioned approach solving the fully coupled system. The latter is treated by means of a combination of a Backward\textendash Euler method and an accelerated Gauss\textendash Seidel/Multilevel-Newton scheme to solve the resulting system of algebraic equations within each time-integration step. Additionally, we consider a specific treatment of the interpolation between different meshes within the partitioned approach. This is shown for p-version finite elements based on hierarchical shape functions. Finally, it turns out that the specific constitutive model of small-strain thermo-viscoplasticity, which is based on the decomposition into kinematic hardening and energy storing strains, yields a problem-adapted stress algorithm. This allows to reduce the stress algorithm on Gauss-point level to the solution of one scalar equation. Numerical examples serve to elucidate the behavior and properties of the proposed methods.},

Using a consistent linearization, this system of equations can be solved with a non-smooth variant of Newton's method. A quadrature point-wise decoupled plastic constraint enforcement and the use of so-called dual basis functions in the mortar contact formulation allow for a condensation of all additionally introduced variables, thus resulting in an efficient formulation that contains discrete displacement and temperature degrees of freedom only, while, at the same time, an exact constraint enforcement is assured.

Verification results demonstrate the expected order-of-accuracy for the stabilized FE discretization. The approach is tested on a variety of prototype problems, including both low-Lundquist number (e.g., an MHD Faraday conduction pump and a hydromagnetic Rayleigh\textendash Bernard linear stability calculation) and moderately-high Lundquist number (magnetic island coalescence problem) examples. Initial results that explore the scaling of the solution methods are presented on up to 4096 processors for problems with up to 64M unknowns on a CrayXT3/4. Additionally, a large-scale proof-of-capability calculation for 1 billion unknowns for the MHD Faraday pump problem on 24,000 cores is presented.},

An appropriate framework for constitutive modelling is introduced that includes a stress-free thermally expanded configuration and a plastically deformed unstressed damaged configuration. A two-level iterative scheme is employed at each time increment to solve the field equations governing the conservation of momentum (mechanical step) and the conservation of energy (thermal step) for the coupled thermo-mechanical problem. Exact linearizations for the calculation of the tangent stiffness are performed in each of these solution steps. A fully implicit, thermo-mechanically coupled and incrementally objective Euler-backward radial return based map is developed for the time integration of the constitutive equations. The present model is used to analyse a number of benchmark examples including metal forming processes wherein temperature and the accumulated damage play an important role in influencing the deformation mechanism and the nature of the deformed workpiece.

This paper proposes to overcome these problems by considering the fluid and the structure as a unique continuous medium, to be studied in a fixed reference configuration. The resulting problem is then split into a fluid and a structural part through an additive decomposition of the space of kinematically admissible test functions. This approach treats the structure in a fully Lagrangian way and uses an associated arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) formulation for the fluid. Such a strategy has three advantages which are detailed in the present paper. \textbullet{} it can be discretised in time by implicit, stable, energy conserving time integration schemes, and solved by simple, iterative uncoupled algorithms; \textbullet{} the fluid and the structural problems can be approximated by independent finite element spaces; \textbullet{} the most recent geometrically exact nonlinear shell models can be used for the structures. The full strategy has been implemented into an industrial CFD code. Results obtained in the simulation of industrial hydraulic shock absorbers are presented at the end of the paper.},

Although routine thermomechanical problems are primarily influenced by classical effects, issues where non-classical influences may become important are also addressed. To date, numerous applications ranging from defense, aerospace to manufacturing related problems including routine mechanical, civil, nuclear and allied engineering applications influenced by thermal-structural interactions continue to pose significant challenges both from the underlying mechanics and from a computational viewpoint. Herein is first presented an overview of non-classical and classical dynamic thermoelasticity models and equations governing these situations. Subsequently, attention is focused on computational approaches for the modeling and analysis of various classes of problems encompassing thermal-structural interactions which can be broadly classified as: i) thermally-induced stress wave propagation problems, ii) thermally-induced dynamic (inertial type) problems, and iii) the general field of thermal stresses. A variety of illustrative numerical examples encompassing non-classical and classical influences are finally presented to provide an improved understanding of the behavior of thermal-structural problems via effective unified computational developments.

Though saturation was not fully reached even with twisted rods, curves representing the experimental results for copper indicate that it would have been reached at a plastic strain very little greater than the strain at fracture. The amount of cold work necessary to saturate copper with latent energy at 15\textdegree{} C. is thus found to be slightly greater than 14 calories per gram. By using compression instead of torsion, it was found possible to do much more cold work on copper than this, and compression tests revealed the fact that the compressive stress increases with increasing strain till the total applied cold work was equivalent to 15 calories per gram. No further rise in compressive stress occurred with further compression even though the specimen was compressed till its height was only 1/53rd of its original height.},

The major goal is to accurately capture the temperature jump across the macroscopic interface in the finite deformation regime with finite deviations from the equilibrium temperature. Motivated by the limit of scale separation, a two-phase thermomechanically decoupled methodology is introduced, wherein a purely mechanical contact problem is followed by a purely thermal one. In order to correctly take into account finite size effects that are inherent to the problem, this algorithmically consistent two-phase framework is cast within a self-consistent iterative scheme that acts as a first-order corrector. For a comparison with alternative coupled homogenization frameworks as well as for numerical validation, a mortar-based thermomechanical contact algorithm is introduced. This algorithm is uniformly applicable to all orders of isogeometric discretizations through non-uniform rational B-spline basis functions. Overall, the two-phase approach combined with the mortar contact algorithm delivers a computational framework of optimal efficiency that can accurately represent the geometry of smooth surface textures.

The derivation allows both contacting bodies to be deformable, thereby extending the commonly adopted setting where one of the bodies is rigid. Moreover, it forms a basis for the second step, where a novel micro\textendash macro thermal dissipation equality is established which enables defining partitioning coefficients that are associated with the frictional dissipation as it is perceived on the macroscale. Finally, a comparison of the temperature fields from the original heterogeneous thermomechanical contact problem and an idealized homogeneous one reveals an identification of the macroscopic temperature jump. The computational implementation of the framework is carried out within an incrementally two-phase micromechanical test which delivers a well-defined macroscopic response that is not influenced by purely algorithmic choices such as the duration of sliding.

The overall homogenization framework transfers macroscopic contact variables, such as surfacial stretch, pressure and heat flux, as boundary conditions on a test sample within a micromechanical interface testing procedure. An analysis of the thermal dissipation within the test sample reveals a thermodynamically consistent identification for the macroscopic thermal contact conductance parameter that enables the solution of a homogenized thermomechanical contact boundary value problem based on standard computational approaches. The homogenized contact response effectively predicts a temperature jump across the macroscale contact interface. The strong dependence of this homogenized response on macroscale solution variables of interest is demonstrated via representative three-dimensional numerical investigations. The proposed contact homogenization framework is suitable for the analysis of similar energy transport phenomena across heterogeneous contact interfaces where the investigation of the sources for energy dissipation is of concern.

The framework is composed by promising application-specific preconditioners presented previously in the literature with the common feature that they are able to be implemented for a generic coupled problem, involving an arbitrary number of fields, and to be used to solve a variety of applications. The first selected preconditioner is based on a generic block Gauss\textendash Seidel iteration for uncoupling the fields, and standard algebraic multigrid (AMG) methods for solving the resulting uncoupled problems. The second preconditioner is based on the semi-implicit method for pressure-linked equations (SIMPLE) which is extended here to deal with an arbitrary number of fields, and also results in uncoupled problems that can be solved with standard AMG. Finally, a more sophisticated preconditioner is considered which enforces the coupling at all AMG levels, in contrast to the other two techniques which resolve the coupling only at the finest level. Our purpose is to show that these methods perform satisfactory in quite different scenarios apart from their original applications. To this end, we consider three very different coupled problems: thermo-structure interaction, fluid\textendash structure interaction and a complex model of the human lung. Numerical results show that these general purpose methods are efficient and scalable in this range of applications.},

One wide spread and complex FSI-subclass is the category that studies the instationary behavior of incompressible viscous flows and thin-walled structures exhibiting large deformations. Free surfaces often present an essential additional challenge for this class of problems. Prominent application areas are fluid sloshing in tanks and numerable problems in offshore engineering and naval architecture. Especially when partitioned strong coupling schemes are used in order to solve the coupled FSI problem the design of an appropriate overall computational approach including free surface effects is not trivial. In this paper a new so-called partitioned implicit free surface approach is introduced and embedded into a strong coupling FSI solver. For complex problem classes this approach is combined with the general elevation equation that is closed through a dimensionally reduced pseudo-structural approach. The presented approach shows the same stability properties as a full implicit approach but is by far more efficient\textemdash especially in the partitioned coupled case.},

One of the main goals is to take advantage of the flexibility of the partitioned approach to enable combinations of different simulation software and solvers. Within the frame of this article, we limit ourselves to the case of nonlinear thermoelasticity at finite strains, using temperature-dependent material parameters. For the thermal radiation field, diffuse radiating surfaces and gray participating media are assumed. Moreover, we present a robust and fast partitioned coupling strategy for the fourth field problem. Stability and efficiency of the implicit coupling algorithm are improved drawing on several methods to stabilize and to accelerate the convergence. To conclude and to review the effectiveness and the advantages of the additional thermal radiation field several numerical examples are considered to study the proposed algorithm. In particular we focus on an industrial application, namely the electro\textendash thermo-mechanical modeling of the field-assisted sintering technology.},

Large-scale calculation of the coupled fault zone process is often inhibited by the high-order interpolation of the displacement field required to overcome unstable tendencies of the finite elements in the incompressible and nearly incompressible limit. In this work we utilize a stabilized formulation in which the balance of mass is augmented with an additional term representing a stabilization to the incremental change in the pressure field. The stabilized formulation permits equal-order interpolation for the displacement and pore pressure fields and suppresses pore pressure oscillations in the incompressible and nearly incompressible limit. The technique is implemented with a recently developed critical state plasticity model to investigate transient fluid-flow/solid-deformation processes arising from slip weakening of a fault segment. The accompanying transient pore pressure development and dissipation can be used to predict fault rupture and directivity where fluid flow is an important driving force.},

The experimental results showed that the compression strength, stiffness, and specific energy absorption increased with the decrease in temperature and with the increase in strain rate. It also showed that, the compressive damage morphologies were sensitive to the change in temperature and strain rate. A coupled thermal-mechanical numerical analysis was conducted to find the thermo/mechanical coupling effect on the compressive crashworthiness of the three-dimensional composite tube. The temperature distributions in the braided preform and the resin during the impact compression were also calculated through finite element analysis. From the finite element analysis results, the inelastic heat generation was seen to be more in the preform than the matrix and its distribution and accumulation led to the damage progress along the loading direction.},

We show that a joint potential function exists such that both the conservation of energy and the balance of linear momentum equations follow as Euler\textendash Lagrange equations. The identification of the joint potential requires a careful distinction between equilibrium and external temperatures, which are equal at equilibrium. The variational framework predicts the fraction of dissipated energy that is converted to heat. A comparison of this prediction and experimental data suggests that {$\alpha$}-titanium and Al2024-T conform to the variational framework.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a new 3D continuous-discontinuous heat conduction model to consider the thermal resistance effect of cracks and dynamic crack propagation during heat transfer. Combining this heat conduction model and the finite-discrete element method (FDEM), we construct a coupled thermomechanical model for solving thermal cracking problems in brittle materials. The mechanical fracture calculation utilizes virtual joint elements between adjacent solid elements for fracture simulation. On the other hand, virtual joint elements are not included in the heat conduction model to improve numerical efficiency. When new cracks are generated, the node sharing relationship is dynamically updated in the heat conduction calculation to consider the thermal resistance effect of cracks. In this study, the proposed models are verified by simulating heat transfer, coupled thermomechanical, and thermal cracking problems in brittle materials. The numerical simulations are consistent with analytical solutions, and a complex thermal crack process can be realistically captured. These numerical examples verify the correctness of the proposed models, which can be powerful tools for solving heat transfer, coupled thermomechanical, and thermal cracking problems in brittle materials.},

As only parts of the lung can be resolved in detail in the model, advanced multi-scale techniques are utilized to adequately consider the unresolved parts. Alternatively, we have proposed a comprehensive reduced-dimensional lung model allowing to effectively study pressure and flow characteristics in the entire conducting region of the lung, albeit at the cost of detailed information on local tissue stresses and strains. To combine the advantages of detailed and simplified lung models, we have developed a novel approach for the coupling of 3D and 0D airway models.},

Some approximations for the consistent added matrices, which can avoid the matrix coupling, are proposed. The reasons for convergence difficulty in the weak coupling methods are clarified.

The model is based on a multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient in elastic and plastic parts, together with an additive elastoplastic decomposition of the fluid content. The final relations describing the evolution of the different fields are then obtained in the thermodynamic framework furnished by the principle of maximum plastic dissipation. The particular case of an associated Drucker-Prager model in effective stresses is considered as a model example. A complete characterization of the dissipative structure of the problem of evolution is described through the derivation of an a priori stability estimate. We describe in detail the finite element implementation of the model in the context of staggered algorithms for the solution of the physically coupled problem. Finally, we present representative numerical simulations to illustrate the features of the proposed models. In particular, the case of strain localization in globally undrained conditions is studied in the proposed framework.}

These results are shown to hold for general models of multiplicative plasticity that include, as a particular case, the single-crystal model. The proposed product formula algorithm is designed via an entropy based operator split that yields one of the first known staggered algorithms that retains the property of nonlinear unconditional stability. The scheme employs an isentropic step, in which the total entropy is held constant, followed by a heat conduction step (with nonlinear source) at fixed configuration. The nonlinear stability analysis shows that the proposed staggered scheme inherits the a priori energy estimate for the continuum problem, regardless of the size of the time-step. In sharp contrast with these results, it is shown that widely used staggered methods employing an isothermal step followed by a heat conduction problem can be at most only conditionally stable. The excellent performance of the methodology is illustrated in representative numerical simulations.},

The high-speed compressible fluids are solved using standard finite volume methods. The fluids are fully coupled to general structures that can undergo highly non-linear response due to large deformations, inelasticity, contact and temperature. Particular focus is given on the scheme used to couple the fluid media with the structures. The fluids can also be modelled as low-speed compressible or slightly compressible media, which are important models in engineering practice.

The algorithmic treatment of finite strain elastoplasticity for the solid phase is based on multiplicative decomposition and is coupled with the algorithm for fluid flow via the Kirchhoff pore water pressure. A two-field mixed finite element formulation is employed in which the nodal solid displacements and the nodal pore water pressures are coupled via the linear momentum and mass balance equations. The constitutive model for the solid phase is represented by modified Cam\textemdash Clay theory formulated in the Kirchhoff principal stress space, and return mapping is carried out in the strain space defined by the invariants of the elastic logarithmic principal stretches. The constitutive model for fluid flow is represented by a generalized Darcy's law formulated with respect to the current configuration. The finite element model is fully amenable to exact linearization. Numerical examples with and without finite deformation effects are presented to demonstrate the impact of geometric nonlinearity on the predicted responses. The paper concludes with an assessment of the performance of the finite element consolidation model with respect to accuracy and numerical stability.},

  abstract = {One of the primary challenges in the development of high-speed systems is accurate and efficient prediction of the aerodynamic heating, particularly for lightweight systems where there is a potential for strong coupling between the aerothermodynamic loads and the structural response. A novel approach is developed that corrects heat flux predictions from a pointwise dependency on surface temperature in order to account for surface temperature gradients. This enables efficient construction of a computational fluid dynamics surrogate for aerodynamic heating without a priori assumptions on the surface temperature profile while also accurately maintaining the critical feedback behavior of the surface temperature profile for a coupled fluid\textendash thermal\textendash structural analysis. The method is compared, in terms of accuracy and efficiency, with a hierarchy of approaches for aerodynamic heating prediction. Comparison cases include simple flat-plate heating, as well as shock impingements in two-dimensional and three-dimensional flows. Typically, the approach yields less than 6\% error relative to full-order computational fluid dynamics predictions, and it clearly outperforms all other simple prediction methods in terms of accuracy. Furthermore, it maintains excellent computational efficiency, enabling long-time-record fluid\textendash thermal\textendash structural analysis in complex three-dimensional flow environments.},

Following this methodology, two different loosely-coupled schemes are constructed for the solution of transient nonlinear FSI problems and proved to be second-order time-accurate. Three-dimensional numerical results pertaining to the simulation of the aeroelastic response to a gravity excitation of a complete F-16 configuration are also presented. In addition to confirming the theoretical results discussed in this paper, these numerical results highlight a very stable behavior of the designed loosely-coupled partitioned procedures.},

In the explicit\textendash explicit case where the usually desirable simultaneous updating of the fluid and structural states is both natural and trivial, staggering is shown to improve numerical stability. Using rigorous ALE extensions of the two-stage explicit Runge\textendash Kutta and three-point backward difference methods for the fluid, and in both cases the explicit central difference scheme for the structure, second-order time-accuracy is achieved for the coupled explicit\textendash explicit and implicit\textendash explicit fluid\textendash structure time-integration methods, respectively, via suitable predictors and careful stagings of the computational steps. The robustness of both methods and their proven second-order time-accuracy are verified for sample application problems.

The obtained numerical results demonstrate that, even for fluid\textendash structure applications with strong added mass effects, a carefully designed staggered and subiteration-free time-integrator can achieve numerical stability and robustness with respect to the slenderness of the structure, as long as the fluid is justifiably modeled as a compressible medium.

  abstract = {Abstract Coupled-field dynamic problems in mechanics have been traditionally solved by treating the entire system as one computational entity. More recently, increasing attention has been directed to an alternative approach; partition the governing equations into subsystems, which are treated by subsystem analyzers. The selection of the subsystems may be based on weak-coupling considerations, widely different time response characteristics, isolation of nonlinear effects, or more pragmatic reasons such as the availability of analyzer software. In a staggered solution procedure the solution state of the coupled system is advanced by sequentially executing the subsystem analyzers. Subsystem coupling terms are accounted for by temporal extrapolation techniques. This paper focuses on the formulation and computer implementation of staggered solution procedures for two-field problems governed by semidiscrete second-order coupled differential equations. Such equations find application in the modeling of structure-fluid, structure-soil and structure-structure interaction. Following an introductory description of candidate problems and general solution strategies, direct time integration methods are formulated and applied to the coupled system. Staggered solution procedures are constructed through two alternative approaches which are based upon partitioning at the difference and differential equation level, respectively. Characteristic equations that govern the stability of the resulting implementations are derived, and the selection of stable extrapolators discussed. Finally, possible extensions of staggered solution procedures to coupled-field static and eigenvalue problems are suggested.},

  abstract = {Various multifield problems and among them fluid-structure interaction applications arise in nearly all fields of engineering. The present work contributes to the development of a stable and robust approach for the numerical simulation of fluid-structure interaction problems. In particular two-dimensional and three-dimensional elastic structues interacting with incompressible flow are considered. The structural field is governed by the nonlinear elastodynamic equations while the dynamics of the fluid field are described by the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. Both fields are discretised by finite elements in space and finite difference methods in time. An iteratively staggered partitioned coupling procedure with relaxation is applied to obtain the overall coupled solution. This work focuses on methodological aspects and contributes to a deeper understanding of the theoretical foundations of the approach. This is necessary to ensure that the formulation is stable and offers reliable results for a wide range of parameters. In particular the flow solver formulated in an arbitrary Lagrangean Eulerian approach is considered. In addition to the classical conservation laws of mass, linear momentum and energy geometric conservation has to be considered. This is a consequence of the formulation of the flow equations with respect to a moving frame of reference. The relationship of these conservation laws and the stability of the numerical scheme is investigated and stability limits in terms of maximal time step sizes for different formulations are established. It is further shown how an unconditionally stable ALE formulation has to be constructed. Another key issue is the stabilised finite element method employed on the fluid domain. The derivation of the method from a virtual bubble approach is revisited while special attention is turned to the fact that the domain is moving. A version of the stabilisation is derived which is nearly unaffected by the motion of the frame of reference. Further the sensitivity of the stabilised formulation with respect to critical parameters such as very small time steps, steep gradients and distorted meshes is assessed. At least for higher order elements where full consistency of the formulation is assured very accurate results can be obtained on highly distorted meshes. As another main issue the coupling of fluid and structure within a partitioned scheme is considered. A first concern in this context is the exchange of proper coupling data at the interface which is crucial for the consistency of the overall scheme. Subsequently the so-called artificial added mass effect is analysed. This effect is responsible for an inherent instability of sequentially staggered coupling schemes applied to the coupling of lightweight structures and incompressible flow. It is essentially the influence of the incompressibilty which excludes the successful use of simple staggered schemes. The analysis derived in the course of this work reveals why the artificial added mass instability depends upon the mass ratio but further on the specific time discretisation used on the fluid and structural field. In particular it is shown why more accurate temporal discretisation results in an earlier onset of the instability. While the theoretical considerations are accompanied by small numerical examples highlighting particular aspects some larger applications of the method are finally presented. In nahezu allen Bereichen des Ingenieurwesens treten Mehrfeldprobleme auf, zu denen auch Fluid-Struktur-Interaktionen (FSI) zu zahlen sind. Diese Arbeit tragt zur Entwicklung eines stabilen und robusten numerischen Verfahrens zur Losung solcher FSI-Probleme bei. Hier werden speziell zwei- und dreidimensionale Strukturen betrachtet, die in Wechselwirkung mit inkompressiblen Flussigkeiten treten. Dabei ist das Strukturverhalten durch die nichtlinearen Gleichungen der Elastodynamik bestimmt. Die Dynamik des Fluids wird durch die inkompressiblen Navier-Stokes-Gleichungen beschrieben. Beide Felder werden mit Hilfe finiter Elemente im Raum und mittels Differenzenverfahren in der Zeit diskretisiert. Um das gekoppelte Problem zu losen, kommt ein iterativ gestaffeltes partitioniertes Kopplungsverfahren mit Relaxation zum Einsatz. Der Schwerpunkt dieser Arbeit liegt auf methodischen Aspekten. Insbesondere sollen die theoretischen Grundlagen des numerischen Verfahrens verbessert werden. Dabei ist das Ziel sicherzustellen, das das Verfahren stabil lauft und fur einen weiten Parameterbereich Ergebnisse von verlaslicher Genauigkeit liefert. Besondere Aufmerksamkeit gilt dem Fluidloser, der in "Arbitrary Lagrangean Eulerian" (ALE) Betrachtungsweise formuliert ist. Das Verhalten des Fluids wird also in Bezug auf ein bewegtes Koordinatensystem beschrieben. Daher gilt es hier, neben den klassischen Erhaltungssatzen fur Masse, Impuls und Energie auch die geometrische Erhalung zu beachten. Der Zusammenhang zwischen den verschiedenen Erhaltungssatzen und der Stabilitat des numerischen Verfahrens wird untersucht und es konnen Stabilitatsgrenzen in Form von maximalen Zeitschrittweiten fur verschiedene Verfahren angegeben werden. Weiterhin kann gezeigt werden, wie ein unbedingt stabiles ALE Verfahren formuliert werden mus . Ein nachstes Schwerpunktthema ist das stabilisierte Finite-Element-Verfahren auf dem bewegten Gebiet. Es wird eine Version des Stabilisierungsverfahrens hergeleitet, deren Stabilitat von der Netzbewegung nahezu unberuhrt bleibt. Weitere Untersuchungen betreffen die Empfindlichkeit des Verfahrens in Bezug auf kritische Parameter wie sehr kleine Zeitschritte, steile Gradienten oder auch stark verzerrte Netze. Fur Elemente hoherer Ordnung ist das stabilisierte Verfahren vollstandig konsistent. Es wird gezeigt, das mit solchen Elementen auch auf deutlich verzerrten Nezten sehr genaue Ergebnisse erzielt werden konnen. Besonderes Augenmerk wird auch auf die Fluid-Struktur-Kopplung im Rahmen partitionierter Verfahren gelegt. In diesem Zusammenhang betrifft eine erste Frage den Austausch genauer und methodisch konsistenter Kopplungsinformation an der Grenzflache zwischen Fluid und Struktur. Weiterhin wird der sogenannte "artificial added mass effect" analysiert. Dieser Effekt bezeichnet die inherente Instabilitat, die bei sequentiell gestaffelten Verfahren auftritt, wenn leichte Strukturen mit inkompressiblen Fluiden gekoppelt werden. Dabei ist letztendlich die Inkompressibilitat dafur verantwortlich, das einfache sequentiell gestaffelte Verfahren nicht erfolgreich verwendet werden konnen. Die mathematische Analyse, die im Rahmen dieser Arbeit vorgenommen wird, zeigt, warum die Instabilitat nicht nur vom Massenverhaltnis der beteiligten Kontinua, sondern auch von der Zeitdiskretisierung der Felder abhangt. Es wird deutlich, warum genauere zeitliche Diskretisierungsansatze ein fruheres Eintreten der Instabilitat zur Folge haben. Die theoretischen Ergebnisse werden durch begleitende kleine Beispielrechnungen veranschaulicht. Einige grosere Anwendungen des Verfahrens werden am Schlus der Arbeit prasentiert.},

  abstract = {Abstract We present a method with domain decomposition to solve time-dependent non-linear problems. This method enables arbitrary numeric schemes of the Newmark family to be coupled with different time steps in each subdomain: this coupling is achieved by prescribing continuity of velocities at the interface. We are more specifically interested in the coupling of implicit/explicit numeric schemes taking into account material and geometric non-linearities. The interfaces are modelled using a dual Schur formulation where the Lagrange multipliers represent the interfacial forces. Unlike the continuous formulation, the discretized formulation of the dynamic problem is unable to verify simultaneously the continuity of displacements, velocities and accelerations at the interfaces. We show that, within the framework of the Newmark family of numeric schemes, continuity of velocities at the interfaces enables the definition of an algorithm which is stable for all cases envisaged. To prove this stability, we use an energy method, i.e. a global method over the whole time interval, in order to verify the algorithms properties. Then, we propose to extend this to non-linear situations in the following cases: implicit linear/explicit non-linear, explicit non-linear/explicit non-linear and implicit non-linear/explicit non-linear. Finally, we present some examples showing the feasibility of the method. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

A novel feature of the present algorithm is a flexibility normalization along the partitioned boundary nodes by using a localized version of the method of Lagrange multipliers, thus making the algorithm insensitive to both material and kinematic heterogeneities among the partitioned substructures.

The physical model is restricted to Biot's theory of single-phase flow and linear poroelasticity, but is sufficiently general to be extended to multiphase flow problems and inelastic behavior. The distinctive technical aspects of our approach are: (1) the space discretization of the equations. The unknown variables are the pressure, the fluid velocity, and the rock displacements. We recognize that these variables are of very different nature, and need to be discretized differently. We propose a mixed finite element space discretization, which is stable, convergent, locally mass conservative, and employs a single computational grid. To ensure stability and robustness, we perform an implicit time integration of the fluid flow equations. (2) The strategies for the solution of the coupled system. We compare different solution strategies, including the fully coupled approach, the usual (conditionally stable) iteratively coupled approach, and a less common unconditionally stable sequential scheme. We show that the latter scheme corresponds to a modified block Jacobi method, which also enjoys improved convergence properties. This computational model has been implemented in an object-oriented reservoir simulator, whose modular design allows for further extensions and enhancements. We show several representative numerical simulations that illustrate the effectiveness of the approach.},

We consider slow deformations, so that inertia is negligible and the mechanical problem is governed by an elliptic equation. We use Biot's self-consistent theory to obtain the classical parabolic-type flow problem. We use a generalized midpoint rule (parameter {$\alpha$} between 0 and 1) time discretization, and consider two classical sequential methods: the drained and undrained splits. The von Neumann method provides sharp stability estimates for the linear poroelasticity problem. The drained split with backward Euler time discretization ( {$\alpha$} = 1) is conditionally stable, and its stability depends only on the coupling strength, and it is independent of time step size. The drained split with the midpoint rule ( {$\alpha$} = 0.5) is unconditionally unstable. The mixed time discretization, with {$\alpha$} = 1.0 for mechanics and {$\alpha$} = 0.5 for flow, has the same stability properties as the backward Euler scheme. The von Neumann method indicates that the undrained split is unconditionally stable when {$\alpha$} {$\geqslant$} 0.5. We extend the stability analysis to the nonlinear regime (poro-elastoplasticity) via the energy method. It is well known that the drained split does not inherit the contractivity property of the continuum problem, thereby precluding unconditional stability. For the undrained split we show that it is B-stable (therefore unconditionally stable at the algorithmic level) when {$\alpha$} {$\geqslant$} 0.5. We also analyze convergence of the drained and undrained splits, and derive the a priori error estimates from matrix algebra and spectral analysis. We show that the drained split with a fixed number of iterations is not convergent even when it is stable. The undrained split with a fixed number of iterations is convergent for a compressible system (i.e., finite Biot modulus). For a nearly-incompressible system (i.e., very large Biot modulus), the undrained split loses first-order accuracy, and becomes non-convergent in time. We also study the rate of convergence of both splits when they are used in a fully-iterated sequential scheme. When the medium permeability is high or the time step size is large, which corresponds to a high diffusion of pressure, the error amplification of the drained split is lower and therefore converges faster than the undrained split. The situation is reversed in the case of low permeability and small time step size. We provide numerical experiments supporting all the stability and convergence estimates of the drained and undrained splits, in the linear and nonlinear regimes. We also show that our spatial discretization (finite volumes for flow and finite elements for mechanics) removes the well-documented spurious instability in consolidation problems at early times.},

On the other hand, the fixed-stress split is unconditionally stable when {$\alpha$} {$\geqslant$} 0.5, the amplification factors of the fixed-stress split are different from those of the undrained split and are identical to the fully coupled method. Unconditional stability of the fixed-stress split is also obtained from the energy method for poroelastoplasticity. We show that the fixed-stress split is contractive and B-stable when {$\alpha$} {$\geqslant$} 0.5. We also estimate the convergence behaviors for the two sequential methods by the matrix based and spectral analyses for the backward Euler method in time. From the estimates, the fixed-strain split may not be convergent with a fixed number of iterations particularly around the stability limit even though it is stable. The fixed-stress split, however, is convergent for a fixed number of iterations, showing better accuracy than the undrained split. Even when we cannot obtain the exact local bulk modulus (or exact rock compressibility) at the flow step a priori due to complex boundary conditions or the nonlinearity of the materials, the fixed-stress split can still provide stability and convergence by an appropriate estimation of the local bulk modulus, such as the dimension-based estimation, by which the employed local bulk modulus is less stiff than the exact local bulk modulus.

  abstract = {Abstract This paper considers algorithms for computing the response of a coupled problem with a partitioned approach. One important example treated here is fluid\textendash structure interaction (FSI). Often procedures or even software exists to solve each sub-problem separately, and one wants to couple both. This setting seems to allow only the so-called weak coupling which is not sufficient for some problems. The so-called strong coupling is often a totally implicit formulation, where the system components are evaluated at the same time level. This usually requires an iterative procedure. The FSI problem is cast as an abstract differential algebraic equation (DAE), for which the coupling procedures are developed. With the partitioned approach, one simple and frequently used computational procedure is similar to a block-Gauss\textendash Seidel iteration. It is shown why this approach may experience difficulties, and how they may be circumvented with Newton-like methods still staying in the partitioned framework. The functional and software engineering requirements for the simulation interface are described and analysed. Some simple coupled example problems demonstrate how the proposed procedures work.},

  abstract = {Numerical simulation of fluid\textendash structure interactions has typically been done using partitioned solution methods. However, partitioned methods are inherently non-conservative and generally numerically unstable. The deficiencies of partitioned methods have motivated the investigation of monolithic solution methods. Conservation is possible for monolithic methods, the conditions have recently been presented [E.H. van Brummelen, S.J. Hulshoff, R. de Borst, Energy conservation under incompatibility for fluid\textendash structure interaction problems, Comput. Methods Appl. Mech. Engrg. 192 (2003) 2727\textendash 2748]. In the present paper we investigate the relevance of maintaining conservation for a model fluid\textendash structure interaction problem, viz., the piston problem. To distinguish the effect of the error induced by the interface coupling from the fluid and structure discretization errors, we use fluid subcycling and an exact time-integration method for the structure. A comparison between conservative and non-conservative monolithic methods as well as partitioned methods is made. We show that maintaining conservation has considerable impact on the stability and accuracy of the numerical method. These results also indicate that only for a conservative monolithic scheme the improvement in accuracy over partitioned methods warrants the computational cost associated with a monolithic solution. Moreover, we illustrate the implications that particular combinations of fluid and structure discretizations can have on the conservation properties of the fluid\textendash structure interaction problem.},

On the theoretical side, a Eulerian setting of isotropic thermoelasticity is discussed, based on the Finger tensor as a strain measure. Novel aspects are a direct representation of the Eulerian thermoelastic moduli in terms of the Finger tensor and a rigorous decomposition of the thermoelastic response functions into decoupled volumetric and isochoric contributions based on a multiplicative split of the Finger tensor into spherical and unimodular parts. An algorithmic procedure for the computation of the stress and thermoelastic moduli, based on a representation of the free energy in terms of eigenvalues of the unimodular part of the Finger tensor, is developed and applied to model problems of strictly entropic and modified entropic thermoelasticity. Furthermore, two algorithms for the solution of the coupled problem are discussed, based on operator splits of the global field equations of thermoelasticity. The paper concludes with some representative numerical simulations of thermoelastic processes in rubber-like materials.},

The underlying concept is the introduction of a metric transformation tensor which maps a locally defined six-dimensional plastic metric onto the metric of the current configuration. This mixed-variant tensor field provides a basis for the definition of a local isotropic hyperelastic stress response in the thermoplastic solid. Following this fundamental assumption, we derive a consistent internal variable formulation of thermoplasticity in a Lagrangian as well as a Eulerian geometric setting. On the numerical side, we discuss in detail an objective integration algorithm for the mixed-variant plastic flow rule. The special feature here is a new representation of the stress return and the algorithmic elastoplastic moduli in the eigenvalue space of the Eulerian plastic metric for plane problems. Furthermore, an algorithm for the solution of the coupled problem is formulated based on an operator split of the global field equations of thermoplasticity. The paper concludes with two representative numerical simulations of thermoplastic deformation processes.},

The development of reusable hypersonic cruise vehicles requires analysis capability that can capture the coupled, highly-nonlinear interactions between the fluid flow, structural mechanics, and structural heat transfer. This coupled analysis must also be performed over significant portions of the flight trajectory due to the long-term thermal evolution of the vehicle. The fluid and structural physics operate at significantly smaller time scales than the thermal evolution, requiring time marching that can capture the small time scales for time records that encapsulate the longer time scale of the thermal response. This leads to extreme computational times and motivates research that seeks to maximize efficiency of the time integrations for the coupled problem. The goal of this dissertation is to develop time integration procedures that significantly improve computational efficiency while also maintaining time accuracy},

We present a mathematical framework for assessing some important numerical properties of the chosen partitioned procedure, and predicting its performance for realistic applications. Our analysis framework is based on the estimation of the energy that is artificially introduced at the fluid/structure interface by the staggering process that is inherent to most partitioned solution methods. This framework also suggests alternative approaches for time-discretizing the transfer of aerodynamic data from the fluid subsystem to the structure subsystem that improves the accuracy and the stability properties of the underlying partitioned method. We apply this framework to the analysis of several partitioned procedures that have been previously proposed for the solution of nonlinear transient aeroelastic problems. Using two- and three-dimensional, transonic and supersonic, wing and panel aeroelastic applications, we validate this framework and highlight its impact on the design and selection of a staggering algorithm for the solution of coupled fluid/structure equations.}

This paper proposes to overcome these problems by considering the fluid and the structure as a unique continuous medium, to be studied in a fixed reference configuration. The resulting problem is then split into a fluid and a structural part through an additive decomposition of the space of kinematically admissible test functions. This approach treats the structure in a fully Lagrangian way and uses an associated arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) formulation for the fluid. Such a strategy has three advantages which are detailed in the present paper. \textbullet{} it can be discretised in time by implicit, stable, energy conserving time integration schemes, and solved by simple, iterative uncoupled algorithms; \textbullet{} the fluid and the structural problems can be approximated by independent finite element spaces; \textbullet{} the most recent geometrically exact nonlinear shell models can be used for the structures. The full strategy has been implemented into an industrial CFD code. Results obtained in the simulation of industrial hydraulic shock absorbers are presented at the end of the paper.},

The framework is composed by promising application-specific preconditioners presented previously in the literature with the common feature that they are able to be implemented for a generic coupled problem, involving an arbitrary number of fields, and to be used to solve a variety of applications. The first selected preconditioner is based on a generic block Gauss\textendash Seidel iteration for uncoupling the fields, and standard algebraic multigrid (AMG) methods for solving the resulting uncoupled problems. The second preconditioner is based on the semi-implicit method for pressure-linked equations (SIMPLE) which is extended here to deal with an arbitrary number of fields, and also results in uncoupled problems that can be solved with standard AMG. Finally, a more sophisticated preconditioner is considered which enforces the coupling at all AMG levels, in contrast to the other two techniques which resolve the coupling only at the finest level. Our purpose is to show that these methods perform satisfactory in quite different scenarios apart from their original applications. To this end, we consider three very different coupled problems: thermo-structure interaction, fluid\textendash structure interaction and a complex model of the human lung. Numerical results show that these general purpose methods are efficient and scalable in this range of applications.},

Prominent application areas are fluid sloshing in tanks and numerable problems in offshore engineering and naval architecture. Especially when partitioned strong coupling schemes are used in order to solve the coupled FSI problem the design of an appropriate overall computational approach including free surface effects is not trivial. In this paper a new so-called partitioned implicit free surface approach is introduced and embedded into a strong coupling FSI solver. For complex problem classes this approach is combined with the general elevation equation that is closed through a dimensionally reduced pseudo-structural approach. The presented approach shows the same stability properties as a full implicit approach but is by far more efficient\textemdash especially in the partitioned coupled case.},

Large-scale calculation of the coupled fault zone process is often inhibited by the high-order interpolation of the displacement field required to overcome unstable tendencies of the finite elements in the incompressible and nearly incompressible limit. In this work we utilize a stabilized formulation in which the balance of mass is augmented with an additional term representing a stabilization to the incremental change in the pressure field. The stabilized formulation permits equal-order interpolation for the displacement and pore pressure fields and suppresses pore pressure oscillations in the incompressible and nearly incompressible limit. The technique is implemented with a recently developed critical state plasticity model to investigate transient fluid-flow/solid-deformation processes arising from slip weakening of a fault segment. The accompanying transient pore pressure development and dissipation can be used to predict fault rupture and directivity where fluid flow is an important driving force.},

  abstract = {SUMMARY The necking process of a bar in an uniaxial tension test is influenced by the heat production due to inelastic deformations. Thus, for an analysis of this problem the thermomechanical coupling has to be considered. A finite element model and an associated algorithm are developed for this purpose. This computational tool allows the study of adiabatic processes as well as processes with heat flux. The analysis of the necking process of a perfectly cylindrical specimen shows that, in contrast to isothermal and adiabatic cases, no bifurcation occurs in the case where heat flux is considered. 1. INTRODUCTION A variety of experimental, analytical and numerical investigations have lead to a basic under- standing of the mechanisms pertaining to the diffuse necking process in a circular ductile bar tensile test. A number of papers have been published in which numerical simulations of this phenomenon within the framework of classical elastoplasticity can be found, see e.g. Chen6 or Needleman. Any advanced simulation of the necking problem should consider the fact that heat production due to dissipated mechanical work in plastic deformations will lead to temperature changes in the specimen when the test is performed at finite rates. In the context of a pure adiabatic process the associated bifurcation loads of cylindrical specimen has been investigated by Bruhns and Mielniczuk. Several numerical concepts for coupled thermomechanical processes have been developed in Argyris and Doltsinis2 and Argyris},

Some approximations for the consistent added matrices, which can avoid the matrix coupling, are proposed. The reasons for convergence difficulty in the weak coupling methods are clarified.

The final goal is to get an accurate, efficient and robust numerical model, allowing the numerical simulation of solidification processes in the metal casting industry. Some of the current issues addressed in the paper are the following. A fractional step method arising from an operator split of the governing differential equations has been used to solve the nonlinear coupled system of equations, leading to a staggered product formula solution algorithm. Nonlinear stability issues are discussed and isentropic and isothermal operator splits are formulated. Within the isentropic split, a strong operator split design constraint is introduced, by requiring that the elastic and plastic entropy, as well as the phase-change induced elastic entropy due to the latent heat, remain fixed in the mechanical problem. The formulation of the model has been consistently derived within a thermodynamic framework. The constitutive behavior has been defined by a thermoelastoplastic free energy function, including a thermal multiphase change contribution. Plastic response has been modeled by a J2 temperature dependent model, including plastic hardening and thermal softening. A brief summary of the thermomechanical frictional contact model is included. The numerical model has been implemented into the computational Finite Element code COMET developed by the authors. A numerical assessment of the isentropic and isothermal operator splits, regarding the nonlinear stability behavior, has been performed for weakly and strongly coupled thermomechanical problems. Numerical simulations of solidification processes show the performance of the computational model developed.},

Following the transition from the local to the finite element level the numerical solution of the equations governing the coupled thermomechanical problem for the discretised body undergoing finite inelastic deformations is discussed. A number of applications conclude the paper. First a purely thermal problem is investigated which is followed by the study of various physical effects on the thermomechanical response of an expanding hollow cylinder assuming plastic and viscoplastic inelastic properties of the material. Two examples taken from the metal forming practice - the heading of a steel bolt and the extrusion of an aluminium billet - are treated under the aspect of thermomechanical coupling. The paper confirms in the authors' opinion the luminous clarity of the natural approach.},

  abstract = {In this paper we present the formulation and numerical analysis of a finite deformation model of coupled poro-plasticity. Fully saturated conditions are assumed. The model is based on a multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient in elastic and plastic parts, together with an additive elastoplastic decomposition of the fluid content. The final relations describing the evolution of the different fields are then obtained in the thermodynamic framework furnished by the principle of maximum plastic dissipation. The particular case of an associated Drucker-Prager model in effective stresses is considered as a model example. A complete characterization of the dissipative structure of the problem of evolution is described through the derivation of an a priori stability estimate. We describe in detail the finite element implementation of the model in the context of staggered algorithms for the solution of the physically coupled problem. Finally, we present representative numerical simulations to illustrate the features of the proposed models. In particular, the case of strain localization in globally undrained conditions is studied in the proposed framework.},

This class of methods was first introduced by the authors (in the general context of thermoplasticity) in the USCM held at Chicago, July 1991, and in the IUTAM symposium held at Hannover, Germany, September 1991 The proposed schemes are fractional step methods associated with a two phase operator split of the full non-linear system of thermoelasticity into an adiabatic elastodynamics phase, followed by a heat conduction phase at fixed configuration. This operator split is shown to inherit the contractivity property of the full problem of evolution, thus leading to unconditionally B-stable product formula algorithms. In sharp contrast with this stability result, traditional staggered algorithms based on an isothermal mechanical phase followed by a heat conduction phase with an effective heat source are shown to lead, at best, to conditionally stable schemes. It is further shown that the actual implementation of these two classes of schemes is essentially identical. The numerical simulations presented include both dynamic and quasi-static problems and are shown to closely replicate the stability estimates and non-linear stability results derived for these two classes of staggered schemes.},

These results are shown to hold for general models of multiplicative plasticity that include, as a particular case, the single-crystal model. The proposed product formula algorithm is designed via an entropy based operator split that yields one of the first known staggered algorithms that retains the property of nonlinear unconditional stability. The scheme employs an isentropic step, in which the total entropy is held constant, followed by a heat conduction step (with nonlinear source) at fixed configuration. The nonlinear stability analysis shows that the proposed staggered scheme inherits the a priori energy estimate for the continuum problem, regardless of the size of the time-step. In sharp contrast with these results, it is shown that widely used staggered methods employing an isothermal step followed by a heat conduction problem can be at most only conditionally stable. The excellent performance of the methodology is illustrated in representative numerical simulations.},

  abstract = {The thermally coupled incompressible inductionless magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) problem models the flow of an electrically charged fluid under the influence of an external electromagnetic field with thermal coupling. This system of partial differential equations is strongly coupled and highly nonlinear for real cases of interest. Therefore, fully implicit time integration schemes are very desirable in order to capture the different physical scales of the problem at hand. However, solving the multiphysics linear systems of equations resulting from such algorithms is a very challenging task which requires efficient and scalable preconditioners. In this work, a new family of recursive block LU preconditioners is designed and tested for solving the thermally coupled inductionless MHD equations. These preconditioners are obtained after splitting the fully coupled matrix into one-physics problems for every variable (velocity, pressure, current density, electric potential and temperature) that can be optimally solved, e.g., using preconditioned domain decomposition algorithms. The main idea is to arrange the original matrix into an (arbitrary) 2\texttimes 2 block matrix, and consider an LU preconditioner obtained by approximating the corresponding Schur complement. For every one of the diagonal blocks in the LU preconditioner, if it involves more than one type of unknowns, we proceed the same way in a recursive fashion. This approach is stated in an abstract way, and can be straightforwardly applied to other multiphysics problems. Further, we precisely explain a flexible and general software design for the code implementation of this type of preconditioners.},

The high-speed compressible fluids are solved using standard finite volume methods. The fluids are fully coupled to general structures that can undergo highly non-linear response due to large deformations, inelasticity, contact and temperature. Particular focus is given on the scheme used to couple the fluid media with the structures. The fluids can also be modelled as low-speed compressible or slightly compressible media, which are important models in engineering practice.

The algorithmic treatment of finite strain elastoplasticity for the solid phase is based on multiplicative decomposition and is coupled with the algorithm for fluid flow via the Kirchhoff pore water pressure. A two-field mixed finite element formulation is employed in which the nodal solid displacements and the nodal pore water pressures are coupled via the linear momentum and mass balance equations. The constitutive model for the solid phase is represented by modified Cam\textemdash Clay theory formulated in the Kirchhoff principal stress space, and return mapping is carried out in the strain space defined by the invariants of the elastic logarithmic principal stretches. The constitutive model for fluid flow is represented by a generalized Darcy's law formulated with respect to the current configuration. The finite element model is fully amenable to exact linearization. Numerical examples with and without finite deformation effects are presented to demonstrate the impact of geometric nonlinearity on the predicted responses. The paper concludes with an assessment of the performance of the finite element consolidation model with respect to accuracy and numerical stability.},

The application that we have in mind is FSI simulation for blood flow in large human arteries, but the discussion applies as well to several FSI problems in which an incompressible fluid interacts with a thin elastic structure. To carry out the mathematical analysis, we consider a simplified model representing the interaction between a potential fluid and a linear elastic thin tube.

  abstract = {This work describes the formulation adopted for the numerical simulation of the friction stir welding (FSW) process. FSW is a solid-state joining process (the metal is not melted during the process) devised for applications where the original metallurgical characteristics must be retained. This process is primarily used on aluminum alloys, and most often on large pieces which cannot be easily heat treated to recover temper characteristics. Heat is either induced by the friction between the tool shoulder and the work pieces or generated by the mechanical mixing (stirring and forging) process without reaching the melting point (solid-state process). To simulate this kind of welding process, a fully coupled thermo-mechanical solution is adopted. A sliding mesh, rotating together with the pin (ALE formulation), is used to avoid the extremely large distortions of the mesh around the tool in the so called stirring zone while the rest of the mesh of the sheet is fixed (Eulerian formulation). The orthogonal subgrid scale (OSS) technique is used to stabilize the mixed velocity\textendash pressure formulation adopted to solve the Stokes problem. This stabilized formulation can deal with the incompressible behavior of the material allowing for equal linear interpolation for both the velocity and the pressure fields. The material behavior is characterized either by Norton\textendash Hoff or Sheppard\textendash Wright rigid thermo-visco-plastic constitutive models. Both the frictional heating due to the contact interaction between the surface of the tool and the sheet, and the heat induced by the visco-plastic dissipation of the stirring material have been taken into account. Heat convection and heat radiation models are used to dissipate the heat through the boundaries. Both the streamline-upwind/Petrov\textendash Galerkin (SUPG) formulation and the OSS stabilization technique have been implemented to stabilize the convective term in the balance of energy equation. The numerical simulations presented are intended to show the accuracy of the proposed methodology and its capability to study real FSW processes where a non-circular pin is often used.},

Structural and thermal fields are independently discretised via finite elements. The resulting system of equations is solved via a monolithic thermo-structure interaction scheme, which is constructed by a block Gauss\textendash Seidel preconditioner in combination with algebraic multigrid methods. The proposed method is tested for four numerical examples, the second Danilovskaya problem, a simplified rocket nozzle configuration, an internally loaded hollow sphere, and a fully three-dimensional nozzle configuration of a subscale thrust chamber. Good agreement of the numerical results with results from the literature is observed. Furthermore, it is shown that the monolithic solution algorithm can handle the complete range of the parameter spectrum, whereas partitioned algorithms are limited to a certain parameter range only. Moreover, the monolithic algorithm exhibits improved efficiency and robustness compared to partitioned algorithms. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2013 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {Fluid-structure interaction refers to the mutual interaction between a fluid flow and a deforming structure. This phenomenon occurs due to the blood flow in our arteries and also during the inflation of a balloon. To simulate fluid-structure interaction problems, both flow equations and the structural equations have to be solved. Partitioned techniques solve the flow equations and the structural equations separately by coupling a flow solver with a structural solver. However, as the governing equations are solved separately, the stresses and displacements on the fluid-structure interface are not automatically in equilibrium. Therefore, coupling iterations between the flow solver and the structural solver have to be performed in each time step of the partitioned simulation if the interaction between the flow and the structure is strong. In this research, the stability of a simple coupling algorithm has been investigated to gain insight into the difficulties of partitioned fluid-structure interaction simulations. Furthermore, existing and more complex algorithms have been compared and several new algorithms have been developed. Most of these algorithms do not require knowledge or more modification of the internals of the flow solver and the structural solver. Finally, fluid-structure interaction problems involving free surface flow have been solved.},

The fluid flow considered is governed by the incompressible Navier\textendash Stokes equations and modelled with stabilised low order velocity\textendash pressure finite elements. The motion of the fluid domain is accounted for by an arbitrary Lagrangian\textendash Eulerian (ALE) strategy. The structure is represented by means of an appropriate standard finite element formulation. For the temporal discretisation of both fluid and solid bodies, the discrete implicit generalised-{$\alpha$} method is employed. An important aspect of the presented work is the introduction of the independent interface discretisation, which allows an efficient, modular and expandable implementation of the solution strategy. A simple data transfer strategy based on a finite element type interpolation of the interface degrees of freedom guarantees kinematic consistency and equilibrium of the stresses along the interface. The resulting strongly coupled set of non-linear equations is solved by means of a novel partitioned solution procedure, which is based on the Newton\textendash Raphson methodology and incorporates the full linearisation of the overall incremental problem. Thus, asymptotically quadratic convergence of the residuals is achieved. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the robustness and efficiency of the methodology.},

  abstract = {This paper deals with the numerical simulation of friction stir welding (FSW) processes. FSW techniques are used in many industrial applications and particularly in the aeronautic and aerospace industries, where the quality of the joining is of essential importance. The analysis is focused either at global level, considering the full component to be jointed, or locally, studying more in detail the heat affected zone (HAZ). The analysis at global (structural component) level is performed defining the problem in the Lagrangian setting while, at local level, an apropos kinematic framework which makes use of an efficient combination of Lagrangian (pin), Eulerian (metal sheet) and ALE (stirring zone) descriptions for the different computational sub-domains is introduced for the numerical modeling. As a result, the analysis can deal with complex (non-cylindrical) pin-shapes and the extremely large deformation of the material at the HAZ without requiring any remeshing or remapping tools. A fully coupled thermo-mechanical framework is proposed for the computational modeling of the FSW processes proposed both at local and global level. A staggered algorithm based on an isothermal fractional step method is introduced. To account for the isochoric behavior of the material when the temperature range is close to the melting point or due to the predominant deviatoric deformations induced by the visco-plastic response, a mixed finite element technology is introduced. The Variational Multi Scale method is used to circumvent the LBB stability condition allowing the use of linear/linear P1/P1 interpolations for displacement (or velocity, ALE/Eulerian formulation) and pressure fields, respectively. The same stabilization strategy is adopted to tackle the instabilities of the temperature field, inherent characteristic of convective dominated problems (thermal analysis in ALE/Eulerian kinematic framework). At global level, the material behavior is characterized by a thermo\textendash elasto\textendash viscoplastic constitutive model. The analysis at local level is characterized by a rigid thermo\textendash visco-plastic constitutive model. Different thermally coupled (non-Newtonian) fluid-like models as Norton\textendash Hoff, Carreau or Sheppard\textendash Wright, among others are tested. To better understand the material flow pattern in the stirring zone, a (Lagrangian based) particle tracing is carried out while post-processing FSW results. A coupling strategy between the analysis of the process zone nearby the pin-tool (local level analysis) and the simulation carried out for the entire structure to be welded (global level analysis) is implemented to accurately predict the temperature histories and, thereby, the residual stresses in FSW.},

These include physics-based methods, such as SIMPLE, and purely algebraic preconditioners based on the approximation of the Schur complement. All these techniques can be represented as approximate block factorization (ABF) type preconditioners. The goal is to decompose the application of the preconditioner into simplified sub-systems in which scalable multi-level type solvers can be applied. In this paper we develop a taxonomy of these ideas based on an adaptation of a generalized approximate factorization of the Navier\textendash Stokes system first presented in [A. Quarteroni, F.

This taxonomy illuminates the similarities and differences among these preconditioners and the central role played by efficient approximation of certain Schur complement operators. We then present a parallel computational study that examines the performance of these methods and compares them to an additive Schwarz domain decomposition (DD) algorithm. Results are presented for two and three-dimensional steady state problems for enclosed domains and inflow/outflow systems on both structured and unstructured meshes.

  abstract = {The purposes of this article are to present new aspects of modeling multi-physically coupled fields, focusing particularly on the partitioned treatment of electro-thermo-mechanical problems. Coupled problems of this kind occur in many industrial applications, such as micro-electrical devices, field-assisted sintering processes or electrical fuses. In this paper, we restrict ourselves to the case of nonlinear thermo-elasticity at finite strains and a heat source resulting from the electrical field. Plasticity effects are not taken into consideration. The objective is to ascertain the coupling of the algorithm relating to the fields involved individually and to demonstrate a global partitioned solution strategy. We also introduce several methods that increase algorithmic stability and accelerate the iterative coupling process. This article aims to present an efficient partitioned coupling strategy for different coupling levels between the fields. To this end, we study the proposed algorithm with the help of several numerical examples ranging from linear to highly nonlinear problems, involving substantial geometric changes and finite strains.},

Following this methodology, two different loosely-coupled schemes are constructed for the solution of transient nonlinear FSI problems and proved to be second-order time-accurate. Three-dimensional numerical results pertaining to the simulation of the aeroelastic response to a gravity excitation of a complete F-16 configuration are also presented. In addition to confirming the theoretical results discussed in this paper, these numerical results highlight a very stable behavior of the designed loosely-coupled partitioned procedures.},

In the explicit\textendash explicit case where the usually desirable simultaneous updating of the fluid and structural states is both natural and trivial, staggering is shown to improve numerical stability. Using rigorous ALE extensions of the two-stage explicit Runge\textendash Kutta and three-point backward difference methods for the fluid, and in both cases the explicit central difference scheme for the structure, second-order time-accuracy is achieved for the coupled explicit\textendash explicit and implicit\textendash explicit fluid\textendash structure time-integration methods, respectively, via suitable predictors and careful stagings of the computational steps. The robustness of both methods and their proven second-order time-accuracy are verified for sample application problems. Their potential for the solution of highly non-linear fluid\textendash structure interaction problems is demonstrated and validated with the simulation of the dynamic collapse of a cylindrical shell submerged in water. The obtained numerical results demonstrate that, even for fluid\textendash structure applications with strong added mass effects, a carefully designed staggered and subiteration-free time-integrator can achieve numerical stability and robustness with respect to the slenderness of the structure, as long as the fluid is justifiably modeled as a compressible medium.

  abstract = {For various engineering applications, the analysis and prediction of damage onset and propagation within ductile materials under thermo-mechanical loading conditions play a crucial role. However, finite element modeling of the influence of the temperature on plastic flow and damage evolution and the back-coupling of theses dissipative processes on the temperature field remains a challenging task, until today. To this end, a thermo-mechanically coupled two-surface damage-plasticity theory is derived in a thermodynamically consistent manner for large deformations. It can be considered as the thermo-mechanically coupled extension of a corresponding isothermal model, which was proposed recently by Brepols et~al. (2020). In this novel theory, the heat generation associated with thermo-elastic coupling and irreversible processes (i.e. damage and plasticity) is derived from the first law of thermodynamics. To overcome the mesh-dependence of conventional local damage models, a gradient-extension based on the micromorphic approach of Forest (2009, 2016) is employed. Besides the theoretical development, the algorithmic implementation into finite elements is discussed, including the computation of the required tangent operators via automatic differentiation. Finally, the fully coupled multi-physical formulation is verified regarding mesh-insensitive predictions of e.g. strain localization, local heat accumulation, material and thermal-softening, as well as crack propagation and back-coupling effects on the temperature field. Quantitative and qualitative comparisons of the model's predictions to experimental data reveal the promising potential of the numerically robust and flexible theory.},

This class of methods was first introduced by the authors (in the general context of thermoplasticity) in the USCM held at Chicago, July 1991, and in the IUTAM symposium held at Hannover, Germany, September 1991 The proposed schemes are fractional step methods associated with a two phase operator split of the full non-linear system of thermoelasticity into an adiabatic elastodynamics phase, followed by a heat conduction phase at fixed configuration. This operator split is shown to inherit the contractivity property of the full problem of evolution, thus leading to unconditionally B-stable product formula algorithms. In sharp contrast with this stability result, traditional staggered algorithms based on an isothermal mechanical phase followed by a heat conduction phase with an effective heat source are shown to lead, at best, to conditionally stable schemes. It is further shown that the actual implementation of these two classes of schemes is essentially identical. The numerical simulations presented include both dynamic and quasi-static problems and are shown to closely replicate the stability estimates and non-linear stability results derived for these two classes of staggered schemes.},

Based on the concept of deviatoric/volumetric split and the replacement of the compatible deformation gradient with an assumed modified counterpart, the formulation developed is applicable to arbitrary material models. The closed form of the corresponding exact tangent stiffnesses, which have a particularly simple structure, is derived. It ensures asymptotically quadratic rates of convergence of the Newton-Raphson scheme employed in the solution of the implicit finite element equilibrium equations. From a practical point of view, the incorporation of the proposed elements into existing codes is straightforward. It requires only small changes in the routines of the standard displacement based 4-node quadrilateral and 8-node brick. A comprehensive set of numerical examples, involving hyperelasticity as well as multiplicative elasto-plasticity, is provided. It illustrates the performance of the proposed elements over a wide range of applications, including strain localisation problems, metal forming simulation and adaptive analysis.}

The key computational implication is this: the closest-point-projection algorithm of any classical simple-surface or multi-surface model of infinitesimal plasticity carries over to the present finite deformation context without modification. In particular, the algorithmic elastoplastic tangent moduli of the infinitesimal theory remain unchanged. For the static problem, the proposed class of algorithms preserve exactly plastic volume changes if the yield criterion is pressure insensitive. For the dynamic problem, a class of time-stepping algorithms is presented which inherits exactly the conservation laws of total linear and angular momentum.

On the thermomechanical side, novel aspects of the proposed model of thermoplasticity are (1) the explicit characterization of the plastic (configurational) entropy as an independent internal variable, (2) a thermomechanical extension of the principle of maximum dissipation consistent with the multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient, and (3) the exploitation of this extended principle in the formulation of an associative flow which characterizes the evolution of the plastic entropy in terms of the change of the flow criterion with respect to temperature. On the numerical analysis side, salient features of the proposed approach are (4) a new global product formula algorithm constructed via an operator split of the nonlinear initial value problem, which leads to a two-step solution procedure, (5) a unified class of local return mapping algorithms which preserves exactly the incompressibility constraint on the plastic flow and reduces to the classical radial return method for isothermal J2-flow theory, and (6) the formulation of a mixed finite element method in terms of the elastic entropy and the temperature field which circumvents well-known difficulties associated with the incompressibility constraint on the plastic flow. The exact linearization of both the product formula algorithm and an alternative simulataneous solution scheme for the coupled thermomechanical problem is given in two appendices.},

The first approach is based on three-dimensional (3D) continuum models of both the airways and the tissue. As only parts of the lung can be resolved in detail in the model, advanced multi-scale techniques are utilized to adequately consider the unresolved parts. Alternatively, we have proposed a comprehensive reduced-dimensional lung model allowing to effectively study pressure and flow characteristics in the entire conducting region of the lung, albeit at the cost of detailed information on local tissue stresses and strains. To combine the advantages of detailed and simplified lung models, we have developed a novel approach for the coupling of 3D and 0D airway models.},

	abstract = {Mechanobiological interactions are essential for the adaption of the cardiovascular system to altered environmental and internal conditions, but are poorly understood with regard to abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) pathogenesis, growth and rupture. In the present study, we therefore calculated mechanical AAA quantities using nonlinear finite element methods and correlated these to [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-metabolic activity in the AAA wall detected by positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT). The interplay between mechanics and FDG-metabolic activity was analyzed in terms of maximum values and the three-dimensional spatial relationship, respectively. Fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT) data sets of n = 18 AAA patients were studied. Maximum FDG-uptake (SUV max ) in the AAA wall varied from 1.32 to 4.60 (average SUV max 3.31 {\textpm} 0.87). Maximum wall stresses and strains ranged from 10.0 to 64.0 N/cm(2) (38.2 {\textpm} 13.8  N/cm(2)) and from 0.190 to 0.260 (0.222 {\textpm} 0.023), respectively. SUV max was significantly correlated to maximum wall stress and strain (SUV max to stress: r = 0.71, p = 0.0005; SUV max to strain: r = 0.66, p = 0.0013). To evaluate the three-dimensional spatial interaction between FDG-uptake and acting wall stress, element-wise correlations were performed. In all but 2 AAAs, positive element-wise correlation of FDG-uptake to wall stress was obtained, with the Pearson's correlation coefficient ranging from -0.168 to 0.738 ( 0.372 {\textpm} 0.263). The results indicate that mechanical stresses are correlated quantitatively and spatially to FDG-uptake in the AAA wall. It is hypothesized that unphysiologically increased loading in the AAA wall triggers biological tissue reaction, such as inflammation or regenerative processes, causing elevated FDG-metabolic activity. These findings strongly support experimental hypotheses of mechanotransduction mechanisms in vivo.},

For the thermal radiation field, diffuse radiating surfaces and gray participating media are assumed. Moreover, we present a robust and fast partitioned coupling strategy for the fourth field problem. Stability and efficiency of the implicit coupling algorithm are improved drawing on several methods to stabilize and to accelerate the convergence. To conclude and to review the effectiveness and the advantages of the additional thermal radiation field several numerical examples are considered to study the proposed algorithm.

First, we develop the entire system of differential{\textendash}algebraic equations resulting from the spatially discretized principle of virtual displacements, the principle of virtual temperatures, and the evolution equations of the internal variables provided by the constitutive model. In the time-integration step this system is solved both using a fully monolithic approach based on a Backward{\textendash}Euler scheme in combination with the Multilevel-Newton algorithm as well as a partitioned approach solving the fully coupled system. The latter is treated by means of a combination of a Backward{\textendash}Euler method and an accelerated Gauss{\textendash}Seidel/Multilevel-Newton scheme to solve the resulting system of algebraic equations within each time-integration step. Additionally, we consider a specific treatment of the interpolation between different meshes within the partitioned approach. This is shown for p-version finite elements based on hierarchical shape functions. Finally, it turns out that the specific constitutive model of small-strain thermo-viscoplasticity, which is based on the decomposition into kinematic hardening and energy storing strains, yields a problem-adapted stress algorithm. This allows to reduce the stress algorithm on Gauss-point level to the solution of one scalar equation. Numerical examples serve to elucidate the behavior and properties of the proposed methods.},

It has revolutionized sheet shaping for small-batch production since its inception in the 1990s, providing an economical and effective alternative to sheet stamping and pressing, which are cumbersome and expensive. However, the materials with poor overall ductility at room temperatures are difficult to be formed by conventional incremental sheet forming. Therefore, several heat-assisted incremental sheet-forming methods have been developed by researchers trying to improve the formability of such materials and overcome the low geometrical accuracy as well. The aim of this paper is to provide a state-of-the-art review on the development of heat-assisted incremental sheet forming. It is hoped that the knowledge provided in this paper can facilitate readers working in this field to obtain a comprehensive view and take a step forward for future incremental forming of hard-to-deform materials at elevated temperatures.},

Through this paper, all critical concepts revolving around MEE materials are discussed in separate sections ranging from the very definition of MEE materials, their material phenomenon, types and properties, to certain fundamental theories and micromechanical models, structural analyses of MEE structures and their nano-sized counterparts, effects of various external and internal parameters and prospective applications of these materials. The present study is in no ways exhaustive to the methods and results observed, but it may be considered as a guide to researchers and scholars about the behavior of MEE materials, wherein critical observations and analyses{\textquoteright} techniques are discussed.},

	abstract = {Simulation tools are increasingly employed towards quantifying the lifetime of photovoltaic (PV) modules while providing valuable insights into the various failure modes. The use of the finite element method (FEM) in this regard has been especially popular because of its flexibility and the ability to quantify stress levels for a large variety of scenarios ranging from process-induced stress up to field conditions. The thermo-mechanical behaviour of the module or its components is often considered due to the link with common field failures such as cell cracks, interconnection failures, glass fracture, delamination and many others. However, the approaches used, the various inputs considered and the obtained results are highly scattered and sometimes conflicting. This work provides a structured review of the reported simulation approaches and resulting insights obtained through thermo-mechanical finite element simulations on commercial as well as novel PV module technologies. The influence and validity of various inputs such as the used material models, boundary conditions and other assumptions are discussed. Learnings and best practices can be leveraged by future simulations to expand on and accelerate the design-for-reliability capabilities of finite element models for PV modules.},

	abstract = {This paper deals with the numerical simulation of friction stir welding (FSW) processes. FSW techniques are used in many industrial applications and particularly in the aeronautic and aerospace industries, where the quality of the joining is of essential importance. The analysis is focused either at global level, considering the full component to be jointed, or locally, studying more in detail the heat affected zone (HAZ). The analysis at global (structural component) level is performed defining the problem in the Lagrangian setting while, at local level, an apropos kinematic framework which makes use of an efficient combination of Lagrangian (pin), Eulerian (metal sheet) and ALE (stirring zone) descriptions for the different computational sub-domains is introduced for the numerical modeling. As a result, the analysis can deal with complex (non-cylindrical) pin-shapes and the extremely large deformation of the material at the HAZ without requiring any remeshing or remapping tools. A fully coupled thermo-mechanical framework is proposed for the computational modeling of the FSW processes proposed both at local and global level. A staggered algorithm based on an isothermal fractional step method is introduced. To account for the isochoric behavior of the material when the temperature range is close to the melting point or due to the predominant deviatoric deformations induced by the visco-plastic response, a mixed finite element technology is introduced. The Variational Multi Scale method is used to circumvent the LBB stability condition allowing the use of linear/linear P1/P1 interpolations for displacement (or velocity, ALE/Eulerian formulation) and pressure fields, respectively. The same stabilization strategy is adopted to tackle the instabilities of the temperature field, inherent characteristic of convective dominated problems (thermal analysis in ALE/Eulerian kinematic framework). At global level, the material behavior is characterized by a thermo{\textendash}elasto{\textendash}viscoplastic constitutive model. The analysis at local level is characterized by a rigid thermo{\textendash}visco-plastic constitutive model. Different thermally coupled (non-Newtonian) fluid-like models as Norton{\textendash}Hoff, Carreau or Sheppard{\textendash}Wright, among others are tested. To better understand the material flow pattern in the stirring zone, a (Lagrangian based) particle tracing is carried out while post-processing FSW results. A coupling strategy between the analysis of the process zone nearby the pin-tool (local level analysis) and the simulation carried out for the entire structure to be welded (global level analysis) is implemented to accurately predict the temperature histories and, thereby, the residual stresses in FSW.},

Residual stresses can be highly detrimental as they can lead to creeping, fatigue, and stress corrosion cracking. The final state of residual stresses in a workpiece depends on its material as well as the cutting-tool configuration such as tool geometry/coating, cooling and wear conditions, and process parameters including the cutting speed, depth-of-cut and feed-rate. However, there have been disagreements in some literatures regarding influences of the above-mentioned factors on residual stresses due to different cutting conditions, tool parameters and workpiece materials used in the specific investigations. This review paper categorizes different methods in experimental, numerical and analytical approaches employed for determining induced residual stresses and their relationships with cutting conditions in a turning process. Discussion is presented for the effects of different cutting conditions and parameters on the final residual stresses state.},

	abstract = {A comprehensive computational framework based on the finite element method for the simulation of coupled hygro-thermo-mechanical problems in photovoltaic laminates is herein proposed. While the thermo-mechanical problem takes place in the three-dimensional space of the laminate, moisture diffusion occurs in a two-dimensional domain represented by the polymeric layers and by the vertical channel cracks in the solar cells. Therefore, a geometrical multi-scale solution strategy is pursued by solving the partial differential equations governing heat transfer and thermo-elasticity in the three-dimensional space, and the partial differential equation for moisture diffusion in the two dimensional domains. By exploiting a staggered scheme, the thermo-mechanical problem is solved first via a fully implicit solution scheme in space and time, with a specific treatment of the polymeric layers as zero-thickness interfaces whose constitutive response is governed by a novel thermo-visco-elastic cohesive zone model based on fractional calculus. Temperature and relative displacements along the domains where moisture diffusion takes place are then projected to the finite element model of diffusion, coupled with the thermo-mechanical problem by the temperature and crack opening dependent diffusion coefficient. The application of the proposed method to photovoltaic modules pinpoints two important physical aspects: (i) moisture diffusion in humidity freeze tests with a temperature dependent diffusivity is a much slower process than in the case of a constant diffusion coefficient; (ii) channel cracks through Silicon solar cells significantly enhance moisture diffusion and electric degradation, as confirmed by experimental tests.},

Combining this heat conduction model and the finite-discrete element method (FDEM), we construct a coupled thermomechanical model for solving thermal cracking problems in brittle materials. The mechanical fracture calculation utilizes virtual joint elements between adjacent solid elements for fracture simulation. On the other hand, virtual joint elements are not included in the heat conduction model to improve numerical efficiency. When new cracks are generated, the node sharing relationship is dynamically updated in the heat conduction calculation to consider the thermal resistance effect of cracks. In this study, the proposed models are verified by simulating heat transfer, coupled thermomechanical, and thermal cracking problems in brittle materials. The numerical simulations are consistent with analytical solutions, and a complex thermal crack process can be realistically captured. These numerical examples verify the correctness of the proposed models, which can be powerful tools for solving heat transfer, coupled thermomechanical, and thermal cracking problems in brittle materials.},

Thermomechanical analysis is critical for EEDs in these applications since excessive heating-induced temperature increase and stress may cause discomfort. An axisymmetric analytical thermomechanical model based on the transfer matrix method, accounting for the coupling between the Fourier heat conduction in the EED and the bio-heat transfer in human skin, the multilayer feature of human skin and the size effect of the heating component in EEDs, is established to study the thermomechanical behavior of the EED/skin system. The predictions of the temperature increase and principle stress from the analytical model agree well with those from finite element analysis (FEA). The influences of various geometric parameters and material properties of the substrate on the maximum principle stress are fully investigated to provide design guidelines for avoiding the adverse thermal effects. The thermal and mechanical comfort analyses are then performed based on the analytical model. These results establish the theoretical foundation for thermomechanical analysis of the EED/skin system.},

The introduced coupled thermomechanical functional extends the classical strain energy function proposed by Ogden. Volume changes due to thermal expansion are regarded for a large temperature domain and play a remarkable role in thermoelastic materials. The non-linear thermoelastic problem is solved within a staggered (fractional-step) method which is based on a two-phase (isentropic) operator split. Each of the two symmetric sub-problems retains the characteristic dissipative structure of the implicit monolithic scheme which consequently results to an unconditionally stable product formula algorithm. The numerical analysis side shows in particular the capability of the theoretical framework reproducing the realistic physical stress-deformation-temperature relations of rubber. Distinctive attention is paid to the thermoelastic inversion phenomena, a remarkable property governing the class of rubber-like materials.},

The KDC method allows discretizing the temporal direction using relatively large time-steps, making the method very promising for dynamic simulations, particularly when high precision is desired. A multi-domain GFDM scheme is also employed where the composite material considered is decomposed into several sub-domains and, in each sub-domain, the solution is approximated by using the GFDM expansion. On the sub-domain interface, compatibility of temperatures and normal heat fluxes is imposed.

However, the implication of the basic postulates and the significance of the related procedure for the development of the constitutive equations is also illustrated in some detail in the context of flow of heat in a rigid solid with particular reference to the propagation of thermal waves at finite speed. More specifically, after briefly examining the nature of the basic equations of motion for a system of particles within the scope of the classical newtonian mechanics, the basic postulates of the purely mechanical theory for a continuum (including its specialization for a rigid body) is re-examined. This includes some differences from the usual procedure on the subject. Next, thermal variables are introduced and after observing a useful analogy between the thermal and mechanical variables, a discussion of a theory of heat (or a purely thermal theory) is provided which differs from the usual development in the classical thermodynamics. A detailed application of the latter development is then made to the problem of heat flow in a stationary rigid solid using several different and well-motivated constitutive equations. Special cases of these include linearized theories of the classical heat flow by conduction and of heat flow transmitted as thermal waves.

	abstract = {Although the issues are not very controversial, the fusion of both the fields of heat conduction in solids and elasticity which results in the so-called field of dynamic thermoelasticity (both non-classical and classical), dates as far back as Maxwell (1867), and has long been a subject matter of widespread research activity and interest. Although routine thermomechanical problems are primarily influenced by classical effects, issues where non-classical influences may become important are also addressed. To date, numerous applications ranging from defense, aerospace to manufacturing related problems including routine mechanical, civil, nuclear and allied engineering applications influenced by thermal-structural interactions continue to pose significant challenges both from the underlying mechanics and from a computational viewpoint. Herein is first presented an overview of non-classical and classical dynamic thermoelasticity models and equations governing these situations. Subsequently, attention is focused on computational approaches for the modeling and analysis of various classes of problems encompassing thermal-structural interactions which can be broadly classified as: i) thermally-induced stress wave propagation problems, ii) thermally-induced dynamic (inertial type) problems, and iii) the general field of thermal stresses. A variety of illustrative numerical examples encompassing non-classical and classical influences are finally presented to provide an improved understanding of the behavior of thermal-structural problems via effective unified computational developments.

It is found that as the total amount of cold work which has been done on a specimen increases the proportion which is absorbed decreases. Though saturation was not fully reached even with twisted rods, curves representing the experimental results for copper indicate that it would have been reached at a plastic strain very little greater than the strain at fracture. The amount of cold work necessary to saturate copper with latent energy at 15{\textdegree} C. is thus found to be slightly greater than 14 calories per gram. By using compression instead of torsion, it was found possible to do much more cold work on copper than this, and compression tests revealed the fact that the compressive stress increases with increasing strain till the total applied cold work was equivalent to 15 calories per gram. No further rise in compressive stress occurred with further compression even though the specimen was compressed till its height was only 1/53rd of its original height.},

Structural and thermal fields are independently discretised via finite elements. The resulting system of equations is solved via a monolithic thermo-structure interaction scheme, which is constructed by a block Gauss{\textendash}Seidel preconditioner in combination with algebraic multigrid methods. The proposed method is tested for four numerical examples, the second Danilovskaya problem, a simplified rocket nozzle configuration, an internally loaded hollow sphere, and a fully three-dimensional nozzle configuration of a subscale thrust chamber. Good agreement of the numerical results with results from the literature is observed. Furthermore, it is shown that the monolithic solution algorithm can handle the complete range of the parameter spectrum, whereas partitioned algorithms are limited to a certain parameter range only. Moreover, the monolithic algorithm exhibits improved efficiency and robustness compared to partitioned algorithms. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2013 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

The motion of the fluid domain is accounted for by an arbitrary Lagrangian{\textendash}Eulerian (ALE) strategy. The structure is represented by means of an appropriate standard finite element formulation. For the temporal discretisation of both fluid and solid bodies, the discrete implicit generalised-$\alpha$ method is employed. An important aspect of the presented work is the introduction of the independent interface discretisation, which allows an efficient, modular and expandable implementation of the solution strategy. A simple data transfer strategy based on a finite element type interpolation of the interface degrees of freedom guarantees kinematic consistency and equilibrium of the stresses along the interface. The resulting strongly coupled set of non-linear equations is solved by means of a novel partitioned solution procedure, which is based on the Newton{\textendash}Raphson methodology and incorporates the full linearisation of the overall incremental problem. Thus, asymptotically quadratic convergence of the residuals is achieved. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the robustness and efficiency of the methodology.},

Holzapfel Graz University of Technology, Austria With a modern, comprehensive approach directed towards computational mechanics, this book covers a unique combination of subjects at present unavailable in any other text. It includes vital information on 'variational principles' constituting the cornerstone of the finite element method. In fact this is the only method by which Nonlinear Solid Mechanics is utilized in engineering practice. The book opens with a fundamental chapter on vectors and tensors. The following chapters are based on nonlinear continuum mechanics - an inevitable prerequisite for computational mechanicians. In addition, continuum field theory (applied to a representative sample of hyperelastic materials currently used in nonlinear computations such as incompressible and compressible materials) is presented, as are transversely isotropic materials, composite materials, viscoelastic materials and hyperelastic materials with isotropic damage. Another central chapter is devoted to the thermodynamics of materials, covering both finite thermoelasticity and finite thermoviscoelasticity. Also included are:* an up-to-date list of almost 300 references and a comprehensive index* useful examples and exercises for the student* selected topics of statistical and continuum thermodynamics.Furthermore, the principle of virtual work (in both the material and spatial descriptions) is compared with two and three-field variational principles particularly designed to capture kinematic constraints such as incompressibility. All of the features combined result in an essential text for final year undergraduates, postgraduates and researchers in mechanical, civil and aerospace engineering and applied maths and physics.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose and evaluate the performance of a unified computational framework for preconditioning systems of linear equations resulting from the solution of coupled problems with monolithic schemes. The framework is composed by promising application-specific preconditioners presented previously in the literature with the common feature that they are able to be implemented for a generic coupled problem, involving an arbitrary number of fields, and to be used to solve a variety of applications. The first selected preconditioner is based on a generic block Gauss{\textendash}Seidel iteration for uncoupling the fields, and standard algebraic multigrid (AMG) methods for solving the resulting uncoupled problems. The second preconditioner is based on the semi-implicit method for pressure-linked equations (SIMPLE) which is extended here to deal with an arbitrary number of fields, and also results in uncoupled problems that can be solved with standard AMG. Finally, a more sophisticated preconditioner is considered which enforces the coupling at all AMG levels, in contrast to the other two techniques which resolve the coupling only at the finest level. Our purpose is to show that these methods perform satisfactory in quite different scenarios apart from their original applications. To this end, we consider three very different coupled problems: thermo-structure interaction, fluid{\textendash}structure interaction and a complex model of the human lung. Numerical results show that these general purpose methods are efficient and scalable in this range of applications.},

The underlying concept is the introduction of a metric transformation tensor which maps a locally defined six-dimensional plastic metric onto the metric of the current configuration. This mixed-variant tensor field provides a basis for the definition of a local isotropic hyperelastic stress response in the thermoplastic solid. Following this fundamental assumption, we derive a consistent internal variable formulation of thermoplasticity in a Lagrangian as well as a Eulerian geometric setting. On the numerical side, we discuss in detail an objective integration algorithm for the mixed-variant plastic flow rule. The special feature here is a new representation of the stress return and the algorithmic elastoplastic moduli in the eigenvalue space of the Eulerian plastic metric for plane problems. Furthermore, an algorithm for the solution of the coupled problem is formulated based on an operator split of the global field equations of thermoplasticity. The paper concludes with two representative numerical simulations of thermoplastic deformation processes.},

The variational formulation allows for general dissipative solids, including finite elastic and plastic deformations, non-Newtonian viscosity, rate sensitivity, arbitrary flow and hardening rules, as well as heat conduction. We show that a joint potential function exists such that both the conservation of energy and the balance of linear momentum equations follow as Euler{\textendash}Lagrange equations. The identification of the joint potential requires a careful distinction between equilibrium and external temperatures, which are equal at equilibrium.

	abstract = {This article addresses a thermo-mechanically coupled problem of thermo-viscoelasticity at finite strains using a monolithic approach. The underlying equations are based on the non-linear transient heat equation, the local equilibrium conditions and the evolution equations of the internal variables. The latter describe the hardening behavior of the material. If the method of vertical lines is applied, its first step{\textendash}namely the spatial discretization{\textendash}yields a system of differential-algebraic equations (DAE-system). Here, we employ the p-version of the finite element method based on integrated Legendre polynomials. This can lead to very precise solutions in the spatial domain. In order to be accurate in the time-domain as well, stiffly accurate, diagonally-implicit Runge{\textendash}Kutta methods are applied to solve the DAE-system yielding a coupled system of non-linear algebraic equations. In this article, the system is solved monolithically by employing the Multilevel-Newton algorithm. Accordingly, a high-order result is obtained in the space and the time domain. The numerical concept is applied to a constitutive model of finite strain thermo-viscoelasticity. Several examples are applied to demonstrate the efficiency and applicability of the numerical scheme. It is especially the transient problems that call for time-adaptive schemes which are naturally embedded in the concept.},

The independent choice of time integration schemes is achieved by temporal consistent interpolation of the interface traction. To reduce computational costs, we introduce the possibility of field specific predictors in both structure and fluid field. These predictors act on the single fields only. Possible violations of the interface coupling conditions during the predictor step are dealt with within the monolithic solution procedure. We present full details of such a generalized monolithic solution procedure, which is fully consistent in its nonconforming temporal and spatial discretization. The incorporated mortar approach allows for nonmatching spatial discretizations of the fluid and solid domain at the fluid-structure interface and is fully integrated in the resulting monolithic system of equations. The method is applied to a variety of numerical examples. Thereby, temporal convergence rates, the special role of essential boundary conditions at the fluid-structure interface, and the positive effect of predictors are demonstrated and discussed. Emphasis is put on the comparison of different time integration schemes in fluid and structure field, for what the achieved freedom of choice of time integrators is fully exploited.},

Existing physics-based block preconditioners have proven to be efficient, but their error assessment reveals an accumulation of the error at the coupling surface. We address this issue by combining them with an additional additive Schwarz preconditioner, whose subdomains span across the interface on purpose. By performing cheap but accurate subdomain solves that do not depend on the separation of physical fields, this error accumulation can be reduced effectively. Numerical experiments compare the performance of the hybrid preconditioner to existing approaches, demonstrate the increased efficiency, and study its parallel performance.},

To be able to deal with non-conforming meshes at the fluid{\textendash}structure interface, we propose the integration of a dual mortar method into the general FSI framework. This method has lately been used successfully to impose interface constraints in other contexts such as finite deformation contact. The main focus is set on monolithic coupling algorithms for FSI here. In these cases the dual mortar approach allows for the elimination of the additional Lagrange multiplier degrees of freedom from the global system by condensation. The resulting system matrices have the same block structure as their counterparts for the conforming case and permit the same numerical treatment. Partitioned Dirichlet{\textendash}Neumann coupling is also considered briefly and it is shown that the dual mortar approach permits a numerically efficient mapping between fluid and structure quantities at the interface. Numerical examples demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of the proposed method. We present results for a variety of different element formulations for the fluid and the structure field, indicating that the proposed method is not limited to any specific formulation. Furthermore, the applicability of state-of-the-art iterative solvers is considered and the convergence behavior is shown to be comparable to standard simulations with conforming discretizations at the interface.},

These results are shown to hold for general models of multiplicative plasticity that include, as a particular case, the single-crystal model. The proposed product formula algorithm is designed via an entropy based operator split that yields one of the first known staggered algorithms that retains the property of nonlinear unconditional stability. The scheme employs an isentropic step, in which the total entropy is held constant, followed by a heat conduction step (with nonlinear source) at fixed configuration. The nonlinear stability analysis shows that the proposed staggered scheme inherits the a priori energy estimate for the continuum problem, regardless of the size of the time-step. In sharp contrast with these results, it is shown that widely used staggered methods employing an isothermal step followed by a heat conduction problem can be at most only conditionally stable.

The final goal is to get an accurate, efficient and robust numerical model, allowing the numerical simulation of solidification processes in the metal casting industry. Some of the current issues addressed in the paper are the following. A fractional step method arising from an operator split of the governing differential equations has been used to solve the nonlinear coupled system of equations, leading to a staggered product formula solution algorithm. Nonlinear stability issues are discussed and isentropic and isothermal operator splits are formulated. Within the isentropic split, a strong operator split design constraint is introduced, by requiring that the elastic and plastic entropy, as well as the phase-change induced elastic entropy due to the latent heat, remain fixed in the mechanical problem. The formulation of the model has been consistently derived within a thermodynamic framework. The constitutive behavior has been defined by a thermoelastoplastic free energy function, including a thermal multiphase change contribution. Plastic response has been modeled by a J2 temperature dependent model, including plastic hardening and thermal softening. A brief summary of the thermomechanical frictional contact model is included. The numerical model has been implemented into the computational Finite Element code COMET developed by the authors. A numerical assessment of the isentropic and isothermal operator splits, regarding the nonlinear stability behavior, has been performed for weakly and strongly coupled thermomechanical problems. Numerical simulations of solidification processes show the performance of the computational model developed.},

	abstract = {The paper outlines a constitutive model for finite thermo-visco-plastic behavior of amorphous glassy polymers and considers details of its numerical implementation. In contrast to existing kinematical approaches to finite plasticity of glassy polymers, the formulation applies a plastic metric theory based on an additive split of Lagrangian Hencky-type strains into elastic and plastic parts. The analogy between the proposed formulation in the logarithmic strain space and the geometrically linear theory of plasticity, makes this constitutive framework very transparent and attractive with regard to its numerical formulation. The characteristic strain hardening of the model is derived from a polymer network model. We consider the particularly simple eight chain model, but also comment on the recently developed microsphere model. The viscoplastic flow rule in the logarithmic strain space uses structures of the free volume flow theory, which provides a highly predictive modeling capacity at the onset of viscoplastic flow. The integration of this micromechanically motivated approach into a three-dimensional computational model is a key concern of this work. We outline details of the numerical implementation of this model, including elements such as geometric pre- and post-transformations to/from the logarithmic strain space, a thermomechanical operator split algorithm consisting of an isothermal mechanical predictor followed by a heat conduction corrector and finally, the consistent linearization of the local update algorithm for the dissipative variables as well as its relationship to the global tangent operator. The performance of the proposed formulation is demonstrated by means of a spectrum of numerical examples, which we compare with our experimental findings.},

Novel aspects are a direct representation of the Eulerian thermoelastic moduli in terms of the Finger tensor and a rigorous decomposition of the thermoelastic response functions into decoupled volumetric and isochoric contributions based on a multiplicative split of the Finger tensor into spherical and unimodular parts. An algorithmic procedure for the computation of the stress and thermoelastic moduli, based on a representation of the free energy in terms of eigenvalues of the unimodular part of the Finger tensor, is developed and applied to model problems of strictly entropic and modified entropic thermoelasticity. Furthermore, two algorithms for the solution of the coupled problem are discussed, based on operator splits of the global field equations of thermoelasticity.

	abstract = {Coupled-field dynamic problems in mechanics have been traditionally solved by treating the entire system as one computational entity. More recently, increasing attention has been directed to an alternative approach; partition the governing equations into subsystems, which are treated by subsystem analyzers. The selection of the subsystems may be based on weak-coupling considerations, widely different time response characteristics, isolation of nonlinear effects, or more pragmatic reasons such as the availability of analyzer software. In a staggered solution procedure the solution state of the coupled system is advanced by sequentially executing the subsystem analyzers. Subsystem coupling terms are accounted for by temporal extrapolation techniques. This paper focuses on the formulation and computer implementation of staggered solution procedures for two-field problems governed by semidiscrete second-order coupled differential equations. Such equations find application in the modeling of structure-fluid, structure-soil and structure-structure interaction. Following an introductory description of candidate problems and general solution strategies, direct time integration methods are formulated and applied to the coupled system. Staggered solution procedures are constructed through two alternative approaches which are based upon partitioning at the difference and differential equation level, respectively. Characteristic equations that govern the stability of the resulting implementations are derived, and the selection of stable extrapolators discussed. Finally, possible extensions of staggered solution procedures to coupled-field static and eigenvalue problems are suggested.},

	abstract = {The thermally coupled incompressible inductionless magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) problem models the flow of an electrically charged fluid under the influence of an external electromagnetic field with thermal coupling. This system of partial differential equations is strongly coupled and highly nonlinear for real cases of interest. Therefore, fully implicit time integration schemes are very desirable in order to capture the different physical scales of the problem at hand. However, solving the multiphysics linear systems of equations resulting from such algorithms is a very challenging task which requires efficient and scalable preconditioners. In this work, a new family of recursive block LU preconditioners is designed and tested for solving the thermally coupled inductionless MHD equations. These preconditioners are obtained after splitting the fully coupled matrix into one-physics problems for every variable (velocity, pressure, current density, electric potential and temperature) that can be optimally solved, e.g., using preconditioned domain decomposition algorithms. The main idea is to arrange the original matrix into an (arbitrary) 2{\texttimes}2 block matrix, and consider an LU preconditioner obtained by approximating the corresponding Schur complement. For every one of the diagonal blocks in the LU preconditioner, if it involves more than one type of unknowns, we proceed the same way in a recursive fashion. This approach is stated in an abstract way, and can be straightforwardly applied to other multiphysics problems. Further, we precisely explain a flexible and general software design for the code implementation of this type of preconditioners.},

In this contribution, we concentrate on the strong coupling fluid{\textendash}structure interaction by means of monolithic solution schemes. Therein, a Newton{\textendash}Krylov method is applied to the monolithic set of nonlinear equations. Such schemes require good preconditioning to be efficient. We propose two preconditioners that apply algebraic multigrid techniques to the entire fluid{\textendash}structure interaction system of equations. The first is based on a standard block Gauss{\textendash}Seidel approach, where approximate inverses of the individual field blocks are based on a algebraic multigrid hierarchy tailored for the type of the underlying physical problem. The second is based on a monolithic coarsening scheme for the coupled system that makes use of prolongation and restriction projections constructed for the individual fields. The resulting nonsymmetric monolithic algebraic multigrid method therefore involves coupling of the fields on coarse approximations to the problem yielding significantly enhanced performance.

	abstract = {This paper considers algorithms for computing the response of a coupled problem with a partitioned approach. One important example treated here is fluid{\textendash}structure interaction (FSI). Often procedures or even software exists to solve each sub-problem separately, and one wants to couple both. This setting seems to allow only the so-called weak coupling which is not sufficient for some problems. The so-called strong coupling is often a totally implicit formulation, where the system components are evaluated at the same time level. This usually requires an iterative procedure. The FSI problem is cast as an abstract differential algebraic equation (DAE), for which the coupling procedures are developed. With the partitioned approach, one simple and frequently used computational procedure is similar to a block-Gauss{\textendash}Seidel iteration. It is shown why this approach may experience difficulties, and how they may be circumvented with Newton-like methods still staying in the partitioned framework. The functional and software engineering requirements for the simulation interface are described and analysed. Some simple coupled example problems demonstrate how the proposed procedures work.},

	abstract = {A recent experiment confirmed that the infrared (IR) local heating method drastically reduces springback of dual-phase (DP) 980 sheets. In the experiment, only the plastic deformation zone of the sheets was locally heated using condensed IR heating. The heated sheets were then deformed by V-bending or 2D-draw bending. Although the experimental observation proved the merit of using the IR local heating to reduce springback, numerical modeling has not been reported. Numerical modeling has been required to predict springback and improve the understanding of the forming process. This paper presents a numerical modeling for V-bending and 2D-draw bending of DP 980 sheets exposed to the IR local heating with the finite element method (FEM). For describing the thermo-mechanical behavior of the DP 980 sheet, a flow stress model which includes a function of temperature and effective plastic strain was newly implemented into Euler-backward stress integration method. The numerical analysis shows that the IR local heating reduces the level of stress in the deformation zone, although it heats only the limited areas, and then it reduces the springback. The simulation also provides a support that the local heating method has an advantage of shape accuracy over the method to heat the material as a whole in V-bending. The simulated results of the springback in both V-bending and 2D-draw bending also show good predictions.},

	abstract = {Many problems of interest, particularly in the nuclear engineering field, involve coupling between the thermal and mechanical response of an engineered system. The strength of the two-way feedback between the thermal and mechanical solution fields can vary significantly depending on the problem. Contact problems exhibit a particularly high degree of two-way feedback between those fields. This paper describes and demonstrates the application of a flexible simulation environment that permits the solution of coupled physics problems using either a tightly coupled approach or a loosely coupled approach. In the tight coupling approach, Newton iterations include the coupling effects between all physics, while in the loosely coupled approach, the individual physics models are solved independently, and fixed-point iterations are performed until the coupled system is converged. These approaches are applied to simple demonstration problems and to realistic nuclear engineering applications. The demonstration problems consist of single and multi-domain thermomechanics with and without thermal and mechanical contact. Simulations of a reactor pressure vessel under pressurized thermal shock conditions and a simulation of light water reactor fuel are also presented. Problems that include thermal and mechanical contact, such as the contact between the fuel and cladding in the fuel simulation, exhibit much stronger two-way feedback between the thermal and mechanical solutions, and as a result, are better solved using a tight coupling strategy.},

The proposed strategy is based on the isothermal split methodology, i.e. the mechanical problem is solved at constant temperature and the thermal problem is solved for a fixed configuration. Nevertheless,the procedure for this strategy is divided into two phases within each increment: the prediction and the correction phases, while the interchange of information is performed on both. This allows takingadvantage of automatic time-step control techniques, previously implemented for the mechanicalproblem, which is the main feature that distinguishes it from the classical strategies. The aim of the proposed strategy is to reduce the computational cost without compromising the accuracy of the results. The new coupling strategy is validated using three numerical examples, comparing its accuracy and performance with the ones obtained with the classical (commonly employed) strategies for solving thermomechanical problems. Moreover, the influence of the time-step size on the accuracy is analysed. The results indicate that the proposed strategy presents accuracy close to the one obtained with the implicit coupling algorithm, while the computational cost is only slightly higher than the one required by the explicit strategy.},

Additionally, the frictional heat generation is also addressed, which is dictated by the contact forces predicted by the mechanical problem. The frictional contact problem and thermal problem are formulated in the frame of the finite element method. A new law is proposed to define the interfacial heat transfer coefficient (IHTC) as a function of the contact pressure and gap distance, enabling a smooth transition between two contact status (gap and contact). The staggered scheme used as coupling strategy to solve the thermomechanical problem is briefly presented. Four numerical examples are presented to validate the finite element model and highlight the importance of the proposed law on the predicted temperature.},

	abstract = {In simulations of contact/impact phenomena using finite element techniques, spurious oscillations and /or numerical instabilities continue to pose considerable difficulty for many analysts. Recently, the combination of thermodynamically based stability estimates and energy-momentum numerical approaches has proven to be useful in developing effective, unconditionally stable algorithms for mechanical contact/impact in the fully nonlinear regime. In this paper, these ideas are extended to coupled interface problems, by developing a new a priori stability estimate for the fully coupled thermomechanical contact problem in large deformations. The model framework encompasses inelastic heating and thermal softening within the contacting bodies, as well as frictional heating and thermal softening of the coefficient of friction on sliding interfaces. Also incorporated are pressure dependent heat transfer across these interfaces, and a fully coupled treatment of the conductive heat transfer occurring within the bodies. Use of the stability estimate to extend energy-momentum approaches to dissipative and thermally coupled phenomena is discussed, as is the development of an unconditionally stable adiabatic split of the coupled problem. The latter is shown to be useful in developing partitioned integration schemes for the coupled equations of evolution.},

	abstract = {This work describes the formulation adopted for the numerical simulation of the friction stir welding (FSW) process. FSW is a solid-state joining process (the metal is not melted during the process) devised for applications where the original metallurgical characteristics must be retained. This process is primarily used on aluminum alloys, and most often on large pieces which cannot be easily heat treated to recover temper characteristics. Heat is either induced by the friction between the tool shoulder and the work pieces or generated by the mechanical mixing (stirring and forging) process without reaching the melting point (solid-state process). To simulate this kind of welding process, a fully coupled thermo-mechanical solution is adopted. A sliding mesh, rotating together with the pin (ALE formulation), is used to avoid the extremely large distortions of the mesh around the tool in the so called stirring zone while the rest of the mesh of the sheet is fixed (Eulerian formulation). The orthogonal subgrid scale (OSS) technique is used to stabilize the mixed velocity{\textendash}pressure formulation adopted to solve the Stokes problem. This stabilized formulation can deal with the incompressible behavior of the material allowing for equal linear interpolation for both the velocity and the pressure fields. The material behavior is characterized either by Norton{\textendash}Hoff or Sheppard{\textendash}Wright rigid thermo-visco-plastic constitutive models. Both the frictional heating due to the contact interaction between the surface of the tool and the sheet, and the heat induced by the visco-plastic dissipation of the stirring material have been taken into account. Heat convection and heat radiation models are used to dissipate the heat through the boundaries. Both the streamline-upwind/Petrov{\textendash}Galerkin (SUPG) formulation and the OSS stabilization technique have been implemented to stabilize the convective term in the balance of energy equation. The numerical simulations presented are intended to show the accuracy of the proposed methodology and its capability to study real FSW processes where a non-circular pin is often used.},

Some fundamental properties of redundant natural coordinate systems of reference are studied, and the local description of the coupled thermomechanical problem is developed a priori in natural terms. Following the transition from the local to the finite element level the numerical solution of the equations governing the coupled thermomechanical problem for the discretised body undergoing finite inelastic deformations is discussed. A number of applications conclude the paper. First a purely thermal problem is investigated which is followed by the study of various physical effects on the thermomechanical response of an expanding hollow cylinder assuming plastic and viscoplastic inelastic properties of the material. Two examples taken from the metal forming practice - the heading of a steel bolt and the extrusion of an aluminium billet - are treated under the aspect of thermomechanical coupling. The paper confirms in the authors' opinion the luminous clarity of the natural approach.},

This work addresses a finite strain thermo-elastic-plastic formulation fully coupled to the energy conservation equation and investigates the sensitivity of the mechanical response with respect to the temperature evolution based on tensile tests for small to moderate temperatures. The results indicate that the initial temperature, sensitivity of the yield stress to temperature and the heat transfer coefficient at the specimen surface play an important role on the evolution of the void fraction, stress distribution and, ultimately, the load-bearing capacity.},

The required penalty parameter is estimated with local generalized eigenvalue problems, based on which an additional harmonic weighting of the boundary traction is introduced. A special focus is put on the enforcement of the thermal constraints at the contact interface, namely heat conduction and frictional heating. Two numerical methods to introduce these effects are presented, a substitution method as well as a Nitsche-type approach.

	abstract = {Multibody contact problems are common within the field of multiphysics simulation. Applications involving thermomechanical contact scenarios are also quite prevalent. Such problems can be challenging to solve due to the likelihood of thermal expansion affecting contact geometry which, in turn, can change the thermal behavior of the components being analyzed. This paper explores a simple model of a light water reactor nuclear fuel rod, which consists of cylindrical pellets of uranium dioxide (UO2) fuel sealed within a Zircalloy cladding tube. The tube is initially filled with helium gas, which fills the gap between the pellets and cladding tube. The accurate modeling of heat transfer across the gap between fuel pellets and the protective cladding is essential to understanding fuel performance, including cladding stress and behavior under irradiated conditions, which are factors that affect the lifetime of the fuel. The thermomechanical contact approach developed here is based on the mortar finite element method, where Lagrange multipliers are used to enforce weak continuity constraints at participating interfaces. In this formulation, the heat equation couples to linear mechanics through a thermal expansion term. Lagrange multipliers are used to formulate the continuity constraints for both heat flux and interface traction at contact interfaces. The resulting system of nonlinear algebraic equations are cast in residual form for solution of the transient problem. A Jacobian-free Newton Krylov method is used to provide for fully-coupled solution of the coupled thermal contact and heat equations.},

	abstract = {In this work, a combined theoretical and numerical approach is taken to consider the dynamic behaviour and the thermomechanical interactions of systems in which friction has an important role. Emphasis is placed on the proper numerical description of fully coupled thermomechanical response on frictional interfaces. From a theoretical standpoint, the first and second laws of thermodynamics are carefully formulated in the context of large deformations, giving rise to a numerical description of contact interaction that is consistent with these laws. Physical observations encompassed by the proposed interface description include thermal softening of frictional response, rate dependence, pressure dependent heat conduction across the interface, and heat sinks on the interfaces created by trapped wear debris. The finite element implementation of the framework is discussed and demonstrated, with numerical examples successfully describing such phenomena as fading braking torque in automobiles and the observed temperature and friction evolution at the interface between a gun barrel and a projectile passing through it. {\textcopyright} 1997 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {A mathematical model for finite strain elastoplastic consolidation of fully saturated soil media is implemented into a finite element program. The algorithmic treatment of finite strain elastoplasticity for the solid phase is based on multiplicative decomposition and is coupled with the algorithm for fluid flow via the Kirchhoff pore water pressure. A two-field mixed finite element formulation is employed in which the nodal solid displacements and the nodal pore water pressures are coupled via the linear momentum and mass balance equations. The constitutive model for the solid phase is represented by modified Cam{\textemdash}Clay theory formulated in the Kirchhoff principal stress space, and return mapping is carried out in the strain space defined by the invariants of the elastic logarithmic principal stretches. The constitutive model for fluid flow is represented by a generalized Darcy's law formulated with respect to the current configuration. The finite element model is fully amenable to exact linearization. Numerical examples with and without finite deformation effects are presented to demonstrate the impact of geometric nonlinearity on the predicted responses. The paper concludes with an assessment of the performance of the finite element consolidation model with respect to accuracy and numerical stability.},

The physical model is restricted to Biot{\textquoteright}s theory of single-phase flow and linear poroelasticity, but is sufficiently general to be extended to multiphase flow problems and inelastic behavior. The distinctive technical aspects of our approach are: (1) the space discretization of the equations. The unknown variables are the pressure, the fluid velocity, and the rock displacements. We recognize that these variables are of very different nature, and need to be discretized differently. We propose a mixed finite element space discretization, which is stable, convergent, locally mass conservative, and employs a single computational grid. To ensure stability and robustness, we perform an implicit time integration of the fluid flow equations. (2) The strategies for the solution of the coupled system. We compare different solution strategies, including the fully coupled approach, the usual (conditionally stable) iteratively coupled approach, and a less common unconditionally stable sequential scheme. We show that the latter scheme corresponds to a modified block Jacobi method, which also enjoys improved convergence properties. This computational model has been implemented in an object-oriented reservoir simulator, whose modular design allows for further extensions and enhancements. We show several representative numerical simulations that illustrate the effectiveness of the approach.},

Large-scale calculation of the coupled fault zone process is often inhibited by the high-order interpolation of the displacement field required to overcome unstable tendencies of the finite elements in the incompressible and nearly incompressible limit. In this work we utilize a stabilized formulation in which the balance of mass is augmented with an additional term representing a stabilization to the incremental change in the pressure field. The stabilized formulation permits equal-order interpolation for the displacement and pore pressure fields and suppresses pore pressure oscillations in the incompressible and nearly incompressible limit. The technique is implemented with a recently developed critical state plasticity model to investigate transient fluid-flow/solid-deformation processes arising from slip weakening of a fault segment. The accompanying transient pore pressure development and dissipation can be used to predict fault rupture and directivity where fluid flow is an important driving force.},

Efficient solution of the resulting equations of motion can be achieved by a modular computer inplementation in which separate fluid and structure analyzers are interfaced through extrapolation of the coupling terms. Such an implementation is herein called a staggered solution strategy. The conventional realization of this strategy is handicapped, however, by severe temporal stepsize limitations. Several stabilized formulations are introduced, which circumvent such limitations and achieve unconditional stability for certain extrapolators. It should be noted that these stabilization techniques are applicable to other interaction problems governed by similar coupled field equations.},

The final relations describing the evolution of the different fields are then obtained in the thermodynamic framework furnished by the principle of maximum plastic dissipation. The particular case of an associated Drucker-Prager model in effective stresses is considered as a model example. A complete characterization of the dissipative structure of the problem of evolution is described through the derivation of an a priori stability estimate. We describe in detail the finite element implementation of the model in the context of staggered algorithms for the solution of the physically coupled problem. Finally, we present representative numerical simulations to illustrate the features of the proposed models.

The fluids are fully coupled to general structures that can undergo highly non-linear response due to large deformations, inelasticity, contact and temperature. Particular focus is given on the scheme used to couple the fluid media with the structures. The fluids can also be modelled as low-speed compressible or slightly compressible media, which are important models in engineering practice. Some solutions obtained using ADINA are presented to indicate the analyses that can be performed. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2004 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

However, the discrete meshes used in the different domains do not have to match at their common interface, especially when different physical fields are involved such as in fluid{\textendash}structure interaction computations. Exchange of information over this interface is therefore no longer trivial. In this paper six methods that can deal with the information transfer between non-matching meshes in fluid{\textendash}structure interaction computations are compared for different criteria. This is done for analytical test cases as well as a quasi-1D fluid{\textendash}structure interaction problem. Two methods based on radial basis functions, one with compact support and one using thin plate splines, are favoured over the other methods because of their high accuracy and efficiency.},

It is also shown how the same combinations of parameters lead, in the case of strongly coupled schemes, to problems that demand a greater computational effort to be solved, requiring for example a high number of subiterations. The application that we have in mind is FSI simulation for blood flow in large human arteries, but the discussion applies as well to several FSI problems in which an incompressible fluid interacts with a thin elastic structure. To carry out the mathematical analysis, we consider a simplified model representing the interaction between a potential fluid and a linear elastic thin tube. Despite its simplicity, this model reproduces propagation phenomena and takes into account the added-mass effect of the fluid on the structure, which is known to be source of numerical difficulties. This allows to draw conclusions that apply to more realistic problems, as well.},

Previous research has shown that the number of coupling iterations increases when the time step decreases or when the structure becomes more flexible which is explained here by Fourier error analysis of the unsteady, incompressible flow in an elastic tube. Substituting a linearized model of the structural solver into the flow solver makes the coupling more stable but is impracticable if the flow solver is a black box. Therefore the coupling iterations are stabilized by coupling with reduced-order models and Aitken underrelaxation.},

In the explicit{\textendash}explicit case where the usually desirable simultaneous updating of the fluid and structural states is both natural and trivial, staggering is shown to improve numerical stability. Using rigorous ALE extensions of the two-stage explicit Runge{\textendash}Kutta and three-point backward difference methods for the fluid, and in both cases the explicit central difference scheme for the structure, second-order time-accuracy is achieved for the coupled explicit{\textendash}explicit and implicit{\textendash}explicit fluid{\textendash}structure time-integration methods, respectively, via suitable predictors and careful stagings of the computational steps. The robustness of both methods and their proven second-order time-accuracy are verified for sample application problems.

The obtained numerical results demonstrate that, even for fluid{\textendash}structure applications with strong added mass effects, a carefully designed staggered and subiteration-free time-integrator can achieve numerical stability and robustness with respect to the slenderness of the structure, as long as the fluid is justifiably modeled as a compressible medium.

Its key components are a fluid time-integrator that is provably second-order time-accurate on moving grids, the midpoint rule for advancing in time the solution of the structural dynamics equations of motion, a second-order structure predictor for bypassing the inner-iterations encountered in strongly-coupled solution procedures, and a carefully designed algorithm for time-integrating the motion of the fluid-mesh. Following this methodology, two different loosely-coupled schemes are constructed for the solution of transient nonlinear FSI problems and proved to be second-order time-accurate. Three-dimensional numerical results pertaining to the simulation of the aeroelastic response to a gravity excitation of a complete F-16 configuration are also presented. In addition to confirming the theoretical results discussed in this paper, these numerical results highlight a very stable behavior of the designed loosely-coupled partitioned procedures.},

	abstract = {Various multifield problems and among them fluid-structure interaction applications arise in nearly all fields of engineering. The present work contributes to the development of a stable and robust approach for the numerical simulation of fluid-structure interaction problems. In particular two-dimensional and three-dimensional elastic structues interacting with incompressible flow are considered. The structural field is governed by the nonlinear elastodynamic equations while the dynamics of the fluid field are described by the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. Both fields are discretised by finite elements in space and finite difference methods in time. An iteratively staggered partitioned coupling procedure with relaxation is applied to obtain the overall coupled solution. This work focuses on methodological aspects and contributes to a deeper understanding of the theoretical foundations of the approach. This is necessary to ensure that the formulation is stable and offers reliable results for a wide range of parameters. In particular the flow solver formulated in an arbitrary Lagrangean Eulerian approach is considered. In addition to the classical conservation laws of mass, linear momentum and energy geometric conservation has to be considered. This is a consequence of the formulation of the flow equations with respect to a moving frame of reference. The relationship of these conservation laws and the stability of the numerical scheme is investigated and stability limits in terms of maximal time step sizes for different formulations are established. It is further shown how an unconditionally stable ALE formulation has to be constructed. Another key issue is the stabilised finite element method employed on the fluid domain. The derivation of the method from a virtual bubble approach is revisited while special attention is turned to the fact that the domain is moving. A version of the stabilisation is derived which is nearly unaffected by the motion of the frame of reference. Further the sensitivity of the stabilised formulation with respect to critical parameters such as very small time steps, steep gradients and distorted meshes is assessed. At least for higher order elements where full consistency of the formulation is assured very accurate results can be obtained on highly distorted meshes. As another main issue the coupling of fluid and structure within a partitioned scheme is considered. A first concern in this context is the exchange of proper coupling data at the interface which is crucial for the consistency of the overall scheme. Subsequently the so-called artificial added mass effect is analysed. This effect is responsible for an inherent instability of sequentially staggered coupling schemes applied to the coupling of lightweight structures and incompressible flow. It is essentially the influence of the incompressibilty which excludes the successful use of simple staggered schemes. The analysis derived in the course of this work reveals why the artificial added mass instability depends upon the mass ratio but further on the specific time discretisation used on the fluid and structural field. In particular it is shown why more accurate temporal discretisation results in an earlier onset of the instability. While the theoretical considerations are accompanied by small numerical examples highlighting particular aspects some larger applications of the method are finally presented. In nahezu allen Bereichen des Ingenieurwesens treten Mehrfeldprobleme auf, zu denen auch Fluid-Struktur-Interaktionen (FSI) zu zahlen sind. Diese Arbeit tragt zur Entwicklung eines stabilen und robusten numerischen Verfahrens zur Losung solcher FSI-Probleme bei. Hier werden speziell zwei- und dreidimensionale Strukturen betrachtet, die in Wechselwirkung mit inkompressiblen Flussigkeiten treten. Dabei ist das Strukturverhalten durch die nichtlinearen Gleichungen der Elastodynamik bestimmt. Die Dynamik des Fluids wird durch die inkompressiblen Navier-Stokes-Gleichungen beschrieben. Beide Felder werden mit Hilfe finiter Elemente im Raum und mittels Differenzenverfahren in der Zeit diskretisiert. Um das gekoppelte Problem zu losen, kommt ein iterativ gestaffeltes partitioniertes Kopplungsverfahren mit Relaxation zum Einsatz. Der Schwerpunkt dieser Arbeit liegt auf methodischen Aspekten. Insbesondere sollen die theoretischen Grundlagen des numerischen Verfahrens verbessert werden. Dabei ist das Ziel sicherzustellen, das das Verfahren stabil lauft und fur einen weiten Parameterbereich Ergebnisse von verlaslicher Genauigkeit liefert. Besondere Aufmerksamkeit gilt dem Fluidloser, der in "Arbitrary Lagrangean Eulerian" (ALE) Betrachtungsweise formuliert ist. Das Verhalten des Fluids wird also in Bezug auf ein bewegtes Koordinatensystem beschrieben. Daher gilt es hier, neben den klassischen Erhaltungssatzen fur Masse, Impuls und Energie auch die geometrische Erhalung zu beachten. Der Zusammenhang zwischen den verschiedenen Erhaltungssatzen und der Stabilitat des numerischen Verfahrens wird untersucht und es konnen Stabilitatsgrenzen in Form von maximalen Zeitschrittweiten fur verschiedene Verfahren angegeben werden. Weiterhin kann gezeigt werden, wie ein unbedingt stabiles ALE Verfahren formuliert werden mus . Ein nachstes Schwerpunktthema ist das stabilisierte Finite-Element-Verfahren auf dem bewegten Gebiet. Es wird eine Version des Stabilisierungsverfahrens hergeleitet, deren Stabilitat von der Netzbewegung nahezu unberuhrt bleibt. Weitere Untersuchungen betreffen die Empfindlichkeit des Verfahrens in Bezug auf kritische Parameter wie sehr kleine Zeitschritte, steile Gradienten oder auch stark verzerrte Netze. Fur Elemente hoherer Ordnung ist das stabilisierte Verfahren vollstandig konsistent. Es wird gezeigt, das mit solchen Elementen auch auf deutlich verzerrten Nezten sehr genaue Ergebnisse erzielt werden konnen. Besonderes Augenmerk wird auch auf die Fluid-Struktur-Kopplung im Rahmen partitionierter Verfahren gelegt. In diesem Zusammenhang betrifft eine erste Frage den Austausch genauer und methodisch konsistenter Kopplungsinformation an der Grenzflache zwischen Fluid und Struktur. Weiterhin wird der sogenannte "artificial added mass effect" analysiert. Dieser Effekt bezeichnet die inherente Instabilitat, die bei sequentiell gestaffelten Verfahren auftritt, wenn leichte Strukturen mit inkompressiblen Fluiden gekoppelt werden. Dabei ist letztendlich die Inkompressibilitat dafur verantwortlich, das einfache sequentiell gestaffelte Verfahren nicht erfolgreich verwendet werden konnen. Die mathematische Analyse, die im Rahmen dieser Arbeit vorgenommen wird, zeigt, warum die Instabilitat nicht nur vom Massenverhaltnis der beteiligten Kontinua, sondern auch von der Zeitdiskretisierung der Felder abhangt. Es wird deutlich, warum genauere zeitliche Diskretisierungsansatze ein fruheres Eintreten der Instabilitat zur Folge haben. Die theoretischen Ergebnisse werden durch begleitende kleine Beispielrechnungen veranschaulicht. Einige grosere Anwendungen des Verfahrens werden am Schlus der Arbeit prasentiert.},

	abstract = {Abstract We present a method with domain decomposition to solve time-dependent non-linear problems. This method enables arbitrary numeric schemes of the Newmark family to be coupled with different time steps in each subdomain: this coupling is achieved by prescribing continuity of velocities at the interface. We are more specifically interested in the coupling of implicit/explicit numeric schemes taking into account material and geometric non-linearities. The interfaces are modelled using a dual Schur formulation where the Lagrange multipliers represent the interfacial forces. Unlike the continuous formulation, the discretized formulation of the dynamic problem is unable to verify simultaneously the continuity of displacements, velocities and accelerations at the interfaces. We show that, within the framework of the Newmark family of numeric schemes, continuity of velocities at the interfaces enables the definition of an algorithm which is stable for all cases envisaged. To prove this stability, we use an energy method, i.e. a global method over the whole time interval, in order to verify the algorithms properties. Then, we propose to extend this to non-linear situations in the following cases: implicit linear/explicit non-linear, explicit non-linear/explicit non-linear and implicit non-linear/explicit non-linear. Finally, we present some examples showing the feasibility of the method. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

A novel feature of the present algorithm is a flexibility normalization along the partitioned boundary nodes by using a localized version of the method of Lagrange multipliers, thus making the algorithm insensitive to both material and kinematic heterogeneities among the partitioned substructures.

	abstract = {Abstract We perform a stability and convergence analysis of sequential methods for coupled flow and geomechanics, in which the mechanics sub-problem is solved first. We consider slow deformations, so that inertia is negligible and the mechanical problem is governed by an elliptic equation. We use Biot{\textquoteright}s self-consistent theory to obtain the classical parabolic-type flow problem. We use a generalized midpoint rule (parameter $\alpha$ between 0 and 1) time discretization, and consider two classical sequential methods: the drained and undrained splits. The von Neumann method provides sharp stability estimates for the linear poroelasticity problem. The drained split with backward Euler time discretization ( $\alpha$ = 1) is conditionally stable, and its stability depends only on the coupling strength, and it is independent of time step size. The drained split with the midpoint rule ( $\alpha$ = 0.5) is unconditionally unstable. The mixed time discretization, with $\alpha$ = 1.0 for mechanics and $\alpha$ = 0.5 for flow, has the same stability properties as the backward Euler scheme. The von Neumann method indicates that the undrained split is unconditionally stable when $\alpha$ ? 0.5. We extend the stability analysis to the nonlinear regime (poro-elastoplasticity) via the energy method. It is well known that the drained split does not inherit the contractivity property of the continuum problem, thereby precluding unconditional stability. For the undrained split we show that it is B-stable (therefore unconditionally stable at the algorithmic level) when $\alpha$ ? 0.5. We also analyze convergence of the drained and undrained splits, and derive the a priori error estimates from matrix algebra and spectral analysis. We show that the drained split with a fixed number of iterations is not convergent even when it is stable. The undrained split with a fixed number of iterations is convergent for a compressible system (i.e., finite Biot modulus). For a nearly-incompressible system (i.e., very large Biot modulus), the undrained split loses first-order accuracy, and becomes non-convergent in time. We also study the rate of convergence of both splits when they are used in a fully-iterated sequential scheme. When the medium permeability is high or the time step size is large, which corresponds to a high diffusion of pressure, the error amplification of the drained split is lower and therefore converges faster than the undrained split. The situation is reversed in the case of low permeability and small time step size. We provide numerical experiments supporting all the stability and convergence estimates of the drained and undrained splits, in the linear and nonlinear regimes. We also show that our spatial discretization (finite volumes for flow and finite elements for mechanics) removes the well-documented spurious instability in consolidation problems at early times.},

	abstract = {We analyze stability and convergence of sequential implicit methods for coupled flow and geomechanics, in which the flow problem is solved first. We employ the von Neumann and energy methods for linear and nonlinear problems, respectively. We consider two sequential methods with the generalized midpoint rule for tn+$\alpha$, where $\alpha$ is the parameter of time discretization: namely, the fixed-strain and fixed-stress splits. The von Neumann method indicates that the fixed-strain split is only conditionally stable, and that its stability limit is a coupling strength less than unity if $\alpha$ ? 0.5. On the other hand, the fixed-stress split is unconditionally stable when $\alpha$ ? 0.5, the amplification factors of the fixed-stress split are different from those of the undrained split and are identical to the fully coupled method. Unconditional stability of the fixed-stress split is also obtained from the energy method for poroelastoplasticity. We show that the fixed-stress split is contractive and B-stable when $\alpha$ ? 0.5. We also estimate the convergence behaviors for the two sequential methods by the matrix based and spectral analyses for the backward Euler method in time. From the estimates, the fixed-strain split may not be convergent with a fixed number of iterations particularly around the stability limit even though it is stable. The fixed-stress split, however, is convergent for a fixed number of iterations, showing better accuracy than the undrained split. Even when we cannot obtain the exact local bulk modulus (or exact rock compressibility) at the flow step a priori due to complex boundary conditions or the nonlinearity of the materials, the fixed-stress split can still provide stability and convergence by an appropriate estimation of the local bulk modulus, such as the dimension-based estimation, by which the employed local bulk modulus is less stiff than the exact local bulk modulus. We provide numerical examples supporting all the estimates of stability and convergence for the fixed-strain and fixed-stress splits.},

Therefore often strong coupling{\textendash}{\textendash}where equilibrium is satisfied jointly between fluid and structure in each time step{\textendash}{\textendash}is desired; the simplest computational procedure is similar to the time stepping an alternating iteration.

	abstract = {Numerical simulation of fluid{\textendash}structure interactions has typically been done using partitioned solution methods. However, partitioned methods are inherently non-conservative and generally numerically unstable. The deficiencies of partitioned methods have motivated the investigation of monolithic solution methods. Conservation is possible for monolithic methods, the conditions have recently been presented [E.H. van Brummelen, S.J. Hulshoff, R. de Borst, Energy conservation under incompatibility for fluid{\textendash}structure interaction problems, Comput. Methods Appl. Mech. Engrg. 192 (2003) 2727{\textendash}2748]. In the present paper we investigate the relevance of maintaining conservation for a model fluid{\textendash}structure interaction problem, viz., the piston problem. To distinguish the effect of the error induced by the interface coupling from the fluid and structure discretization errors, we use fluid subcycling and an exact time-integration method for the structure. A comparison between conservative and non-conservative monolithic methods as well as partitioned methods is made. We show that maintaining conservation has considerable impact on the stability and accuracy of the numerical method. These results also indicate that only for a conservative monolithic scheme the improvement in accuracy over partitioned methods warrants the computational cost associated with a monolithic solution. Moreover, we illustrate the implications that particular combinations of fluid and structure discretizations can have on the conservation properties of the fluid{\textendash}structure interaction problem.},

The development of reusable hypersonic cruise vehicles requires analysis capability that can capture the coupled, highly-nonlinear interactions between the fluid flow, structural mechanics, and structural heat transfer. This coupled analysis must also be performed over significant portions of the flight trajectory due to the long-term thermal evolution of the vehicle. The fluid and structural physics operate at significantly smaller time scales than the thermal evolution, requiring time marching that can capture the small time scales for time records that encapsulate the longer time scale of the thermal response. This leads to extreme computational times and motivates research that seeks to maximize efficiency of the time integrations for the coupled problem. The goal of this dissertation is to develop time integration procedures that significantly improve computational efficiency while also maintaining time accuracy},

This framework also suggests alternative approaches for time-discretizing the transfer of aerodynamic data from the fluid subsystem to the structure subsystem that improves the accuracy and the stability properties of the underlying partitioned method. We apply this framework to the analysis of several partitioned procedures that have been previously proposed for the solution of nonlinear transient aeroelastic problems. Using two- and three-dimensional, transonic and supersonic, wing and panel aeroelastic applications, we validate this framework and highlight its impact on the design and selection of a staggering algorithm for the solution of coupled fluid/structure equations.},

	abstract = {The calculation of viscous flows inside deformable structures faces major difficulties when enforcing the kinematic compatibility at the fluid structure interface and updating the geometry of the domain. This paper proposes to overcome these problems by considering the fluid and the structure as a unique continuous medium, to be studied in a fixed reference configuration. The resulting problem is then split into a fluid and a structural part through an additive decomposition of the space of kinematically admissible test functions. This approach treats the structure in a fully Lagrangian way and uses an associated arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) formulation for the fluid. Such a strategy has three advantages which are detailed in the present paper. {\textbullet} it can be discretised in time by implicit, stable, energy conserving time integration schemes, and solved by simple, iterative uncoupled algorithms; {\textbullet} the fluid and the structural problems can be approximated by independent finite element spaces; {\textbullet} the most recent geometrically exact nonlinear shell models can be used for the structures. The full strategy has been implemented into an industrial CFD code. Results obtained in the simulation of industrial hydraulic shock absorbers are presented at the end of the paper.},

	abstract = {Fluid{\textendash}structure interaction (FSI) problems are of great relevance to many fields in engineering and applied sciences. One wide spread and complex FSI-subclass is the category that studies the instationary behavior of incompressible viscous flows and thin-walled structures exhibiting large deformations. Free surfaces often present an essential additional challenge for this class of problems. Prominent application areas are fluid sloshing in tanks and numerable problems in offshore engineering and naval architecture. Especially when partitioned strong coupling schemes are used in order to solve the coupled FSI problem the design of an appropriate overall computational approach including free surface effects is not trivial. In this paper a new so-called partitioned implicit free surface approach is introduced and embedded into a strong coupling FSI solver. For complex problem classes this approach is combined with the general elevation equation that is closed through a dimensionally reduced pseudo-structural approach. The presented approach shows the same stability properties as a full implicit approach but is by far more efficient{\textemdash}especially in the partitioned coupled case.},

	abstract = {Abstract This study considers the performance of a fully coupled algebraic multilevel preconditioner for Newton{\textendash}Krylov solution methods. The performance of the preconditioner is demonstrated on a set of challenging multiphysics partial differential equation (PDE) applications: a drift-diffusion approximation for semiconductor devices; a low Mach number formulation for the simulation of coupled flow, transport and non-equilibrium chemical reactions; and a low Mach number formulation for visco-resistive magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) systems. These systems contain multiple physical mechanisms that are strongly coupled, highly nonlinear, non-symmetric and produce solutions with multiple length- and time-scales. In the context of this study the governing PDEs for these systems are discretized in space by a stabilized finite element (FE) method that collocates all unknowns at each node of the FE mesh. The algebraic multilevel preconditioner is based on an aggressive-coarsening graph-partitioning of the non-zero block structure of the Jacobian matrix. The performance of the algebraic multilevel preconditioner is compared with a standard variable overlap additive Schwarz domain decomposition preconditioner. Representative performance and parallel scaling results are presented for a set of direct-to-steady-state and fully implicit transient solutions. The performance studies include parallel weak scaling studies on up to 4096 cores and also includes the solution of systems as large as two billion unknowns carried out on 24000 cores of a Cray XT3/4. In general, the results of this study indicate that on this reasonably diverse set of challenging multiphysics applications the algebraic multilevel preconditioner performs very well.

The discussion considers the implementation of a stabilized FE formulation in context of a fully-implicit time integration and direct-to-steady-state solution capability. The nonlinear solver strategy employs Newton{\textendash}Krylov methods, which are preconditioned using fully-coupled algebraic multilevel preconditioners. These preconditioners are shown to enable a robust, scalable and efficient solution approach for the large-scale sparse linear systems generated by the Newton linearization. Verification results demonstrate the expected order-of-accuracy for the stabilized FE discretization. The approach is tested on a variety of prototype problems, including both low-Lundquist number (e.g., an MHD Faraday conduction pump and a hydromagnetic Rayleigh{\textendash}Bernard linear stability calculation) and moderately-high Lundquist number (magnetic island coalescence problem) examples. Initial results that explore the scaling of the solution methods are presented on up to 4096 processors for problems with up to 64M unknowns on a CrayXT3/4.

	abstract = {In recent years, considerable effort has been placed on developing efficient and robust solution algorithms for the incompressible Navier{\textendash}Stokes equations based on preconditioned Krylov methods. These include physics-based methods, such as SIMPLE, and purely algebraic preconditioners based on the approximation of the Schur complement. All these techniques can be represented as approximate block factorization (ABF) type preconditioners. The goal is to decompose the application of the preconditioner into simplified sub-systems in which scalable multi-level type solvers can be applied. In this paper we develop a taxonomy of these ideas based on an adaptation of a generalized approximate factorization of the Navier{\textendash}Stokes system first presented in [A. Quarteroni, F. Saleri, A. Veneziani, Factorization methods for the numerical approximation of Navier{\textendash}Stokes equations, Computational Methods in Applied Mechanical Engineering 188 (2000) 505{\textendash}526]. This taxonomy illuminates the similarities and differences among these preconditioners and the central role played by efficient approximation of certain Schur complement operators. We then present a parallel computational study that examines the performance of these methods and compares them to an additive Schwarz domain decomposition (DD) algorithm. Results are presented for two and three-dimensional steady state problems for enclosed domains and inflow/outflow systems on both structured and unstructured meshes. The numerical experiments are performed using MPSalsa, a stabilized finite element code.},

The experimental results showed that the compression strength, stiffness, and specific energy absorption increased with the decrease in temperature and with the increase in strain rate. It also showed that, the compressive damage morphologies were sensitive to the change in temperature and strain rate. A coupled thermal-mechanical numerical analysis was conducted to find the thermo/mechanical coupling effect on the compressive crashworthiness of the three-dimensional composite tube. The temperature distributions in the braided preform and the resin during the impact compression were also calculated through finite element analysis. From the finite element analysis results, the inelastic heat generation was seen to be more in the preform than the matrix and its distribution and accumulation led to the damage progress along the loading direction.},

The high strain rate mechanical properties of several classes of polymers, i.e. glassy and rubbery amorphous polymers and semi-crystalline polymers will be reviewed. Additionally, time{\textendash}temperature superposition for rate dependent large strain properties and pressure dependence in polymers will be discussed. Constitutive modeling and shock properties of polymers will not be discussed in this review.},

	abstract = {For various engineering applications, the analysis and prediction of damage onset and propagation within ductile materials under thermo-mechanical loading conditions play a crucial role. However, finite element modeling of the influence of the temperature on plastic flow and damage evolution and the back-coupling of theses dissipative processes on the temperature field remains a challenging task, until today. To this end, a thermo-mechanically coupled two-surface damage-plasticity theory is derived in a thermodynamically consistent manner for large deformations. It can be considered as the thermo-mechanically coupled extension of a corresponding isothermal model, which was proposed recently by Brepols et~al. (2020). In this novel theory, the heat generation associated with thermo-elastic coupling and irreversible processes (i.e. damage and plasticity) is derived from the first law of thermodynamics. To overcome the mesh-dependence of conventional local damage models, a gradient-extension based on the micromorphic approach of Forest (2009, 2016) is employed. Besides the theoretical development, the algorithmic implementation into finite elements is discussed, including the computation of the required tangent operators via automatic differentiation. Finally, the fully coupled multi-physical formulation is verified regarding mesh-insensitive predictions of e.g. strain localization, local heat accumulation, material and thermal-softening, as well as crack propagation and back-coupling effects on the temperature field. Quantitative and qualitative comparisons of the model{\textquoteright}s predictions to experimental data reveal the promising potential of the numerically robust and flexible theory.},

To this end, a micro{\textendash}macro mechanical dissipation equality is first established which enables defining a macroscopic frictional traction. The derivation allows both contacting bodies to be deformable, thereby extending the commonly adopted setting where one of the bodies is rigid. Moreover, it forms a basis for the second step, where a novel micro{\textendash}macro thermal dissipation equality is established which enables defining partitioning coefficients that are associated with the frictional dissipation as it is perceived on the macroscale. Finally, a comparison of the temperature fields from the original heterogeneous thermomechanical contact problem and an idealized homogeneous one reveals an identification of the macroscopic temperature jump. The computational implementation of the framework is carried out within an incrementally two-phase micromechanical test which delivers a well-defined macroscopic response that is not influenced by purely algorithmic choices such as the duration of sliding. Two-dimensional numerical investigations on periodic and random samples from thermo-viscoelastic boundary layers with unilateral and bilateral roughness demonstrate the temperature{\textendash}velocity{\textendash}pressure dependence of the macroscopic contact response.},

The overall homogenization framework transfers macroscopic contact variables, such as surfacial stretch, pressure and heat flux, as boundary conditions on a test sample within a micromechanical interface testing procedure. An analysis of the thermal dissipation within the test sample reveals a thermodynamically consistent identification for the macroscopic thermal contact conductance parameter that enables the solution of a homogenized thermomechanical contact boundary value problem based on standard computational approaches. The homogenized contact response effectively predicts a temperature jump across the macroscale contact interface. The strong dependence of this homogenized response on macroscale solution variables of interest is demonstrated via representative three-dimensional numerical investigations. The proposed contact homogenization framework is suitable for the analysis of similar energy transport phenomena across heterogeneous contact interfaces where the investigation of the sources for energy dissipation is of concern.

The major goal is to accurately capture the temperature jump across the macroscopic interface in the finite deformation regime with finite deviations from the equilibrium temperature. Motivated by the limit of scale separation, a two-phase thermomechanically decoupled methodology is introduced, wherein a purely mechanical contact problem is followed by a purely thermal one. In order to correctly take into account finite size effects that are inherent to the problem, this algorithmically consistent two-phase framework is cast within a self-consistent iterative scheme that acts as a first-order corrector. For a comparison with alternative coupled homogenization frameworks as well as for numerical validation, a mortar-based thermomechanical contact algorithm is introduced. This algorithm is uniformly applicable to all orders of isogeometric discretizations through non-uniform rational B-spline basis functions. Overall, the two-phase approach combined with the mortar contact algorithm delivers a computational framework of optimal efficiency that can accurately represent the geometry of smooth surface textures.

	abstract = {Fluid-structure interaction refers to the mutual interaction between a fluid flow and a deforming structure. This phenomenon occurs due to the blood flow in our arteries and also during the inflation of a balloon. To simulate fluid-structure interaction problems, both flow equations and the structural equations have to be solved. Partitioned techniques solve the flow equations and the structural equations separately by coupling a flow solver with a structural solver. However, as the governing equations are solved separately, the stresses and displacements on the fluid-structure interface are not automatically in equilibrium. Therefore, coupling iterations between the flow solver and the structural solver have to be performed in each time step of the partitioned simulation if the interaction between the flow and the structure is strong. In this research, the stability of a simple coupling algorithm has been investigated to gain insight into the difficulties of partitioned fluid-structure interaction simulations. Furthermore, existing and more complex algorithms have been compared and several new algorithms have been developed. Most of these algorithms do not require knowledge or more modification of the internals of the flow solver and the structural solver. Finally, fluid-structure interaction problems involving free surface flow have been solved.},

Although mortar methods are well analyzed for variational inequalities, its application to dynamic thermo-mechanical contact problems with friction is still a field of active research. In this work, we extend the mortar approach for dynamic contact problems with Coulomb friction to the thermo-mechanical case. We focus on the discretization and on algorithmic aspects of dynamic effects such as frictional heating and thermal softening at the contact interface. More precisely, we generalize the mortar concept of dual Lagrange multipliers to non-linear Robin-type interface conditions and apply local static condensation to eliminate the heat flux. Numerical examples in the two-dimensional and the three-dimensional setting illustrate the flexibility of the discretization on non-matching meshes.},

A key feature is the reformulation of all involved inequality constraints, namely those of Hill's orthotropic yield criterion as well as the normal and tangential contact constraints, in terms of non-smooth nonlinear complementarity functions. Using a consistent linearization, this system of equations can be solved with a non-smooth variant of Newton's method. A quadrature point-wise decoupled plastic constraint enforcement and the use of so-called dual basis functions in the mortar contact formulation allow for a condensation of all additionally introduced variables, thus resulting in an efficient formulation that contains discrete displacement and temperature degrees of freedom only, while, at the same time, an exact constraint enforcement is assured. Numerical examples from thermo-plasticity, thermo-elastic frictional contact and thermo-elasto-plastic frictional contact demonstrate the wide range of applications covered by the presented method.},

  abstract = {Incremental sheet forming is an advanced manufacturing technique where a piece of sheet is shaped into a product by a series of small incremental localized deformations. It has revolutionized sheet shaping for small-batch production since its inception in the 1990s, providing an economical and effective alternative to sheet stamping and pressing, which are cumbersome and expensive. However, the materials with poor overall ductility at room temperatures are difficult to be formed by conventional incremental sheet forming. Therefore, several heat-assisted incremental sheet-forming methods have been developed by researchers trying to improve the formability of such materials and overcome the low geometrical accuracy as well. The aim of this paper is to provide a state-of-the-art review on the development of heat-assisted incremental sheet forming. It is hoped that the knowledge provided in this paper can facilitate readers working in this field to obtain a comprehensive view and take a step forward for future incremental forming of hard-to-deform materials at elevated temperatures.},

  abstract = {Residual stresses induced during turning processes can affect the quality and performance of machined products, depending on its direction and magnitude. Residual stresses can be highly detrimental as they can lead to creeping, fatigue, and stress corrosion cracking. The final state of residual stresses in a workpiece depends on its material as well as the cutting-tool configuration such as tool geometry/coating, cooling and wear conditions, and process parameters including the cutting speed, depth-of-cut and feed-rate. However, there have been disagreements in some literatures regarding influences of the above-mentioned factors on residual stresses due to different cutting conditions, tool parameters and workpiece materials used in the specific investigations. This review paper categorizes different methods in experimental, numerical and analytical approaches employed for determining induced residual stresses and their relationships with cutting conditions in a turning process. Discussion is presented for the effects of different cutting conditions and parameters on the final residual stresses state.},

  abstract = {This work describes the formulation adopted for the numerical simulation of the friction stir welding (FSW) process. FSW is a solid-state joining process (the metal is not melted during the process) devised for applications where the original metallurgical characteristics must be retained. This process is primarily used on aluminum alloys, and most often on large pieces which cannot be easily heat treated to recover temper characteristics. Heat is either induced by the friction between the tool shoulder and the work pieces or generated by the mechanical mixing (stirring and forging) process without reaching the melting point (solid-state process). To simulate this kind of welding process, a fully coupled thermo-mechanical solution is adopted. A sliding mesh, rotating together with the pin (ALE formulation), is used to avoid the extremely large distortions of the mesh around the tool in the so called stirring zone while the rest of the mesh of the sheet is fixed (Eulerian formulation). The orthogonal subgrid scale (OSS) technique is used to stabilize the mixed velocity\textendash pressure formulation adopted to solve the Stokes problem. This stabilized formulation can deal with the incompressible behavior of the material allowing for equal linear interpolation for both the velocity and the pressure fields. The material behavior is characterized either by Norton\textendash Hoff or Sheppard\textendash Wright rigid thermo-visco-plastic constitutive models. Both the frictional heating due to the contact interaction between the surface of the tool and the sheet, and the heat induced by the visco-plastic dissipation of the stirring material have been taken into account. Heat convection and heat radiation models are used to dissipate the heat through the boundaries. Both the streamline-upwind/Petrov\textendash Galerkin (SUPG) formulation and the OSS stabilization technique have been implemented to stabilize the convective term in the balance of energy equation. The numerical simulations presented are intended to show the accuracy of the proposed methodology and its capability to study real FSW processes where a non-circular pin is often used.},

  abstract = {This paper deals with the numerical simulation of friction stir welding (FSW) processes. FSW techniques are used in many industrial applications and particularly in the aeronautic and aerospace industries, where the quality of the joining is of essential importance. The analysis is focused either at global level, considering the full component to be jointed, or locally, studying more in detail the heat affected zone (HAZ). The analysis at global (structural component) level is performed defining the problem in the Lagrangian setting while, at local level, an apropos kinematic framework which makes use of an efficient combination of Lagrangian (pin), Eulerian (metal sheet) and ALE (stirring zone) descriptions for the different computational sub-domains is introduced for the numerical modeling. As a result, the analysis can deal with complex (non-cylindrical) pin-shapes and the extremely large deformation of the material at the HAZ without requiring any remeshing or remapping tools. A fully coupled thermo-mechanical framework is proposed for the computational modeling of the FSW processes proposed both at local and global level. A staggered algorithm based on an isothermal fractional step method is introduced. To account for the isochoric behavior of the material when the temperature range is close to the melting point or due to the predominant deviatoric deformations induced by the visco-plastic response, a mixed finite element technology is introduced. The Variational Multi Scale method is used to circumvent the LBB stability condition allowing the use of linear/linear P1/P1 interpolations for displacement (or velocity, ALE/Eulerian formulation) and pressure fields, respectively. The same stabilization strategy is adopted to tackle the instabilities of the temperature field, inherent characteristic of convective dominated problems (thermal analysis in ALE/Eulerian kinematic framework). At global level, the material behavior is characterized by a thermo\textendash elasto\textendash viscoplastic constitutive model. The analysis at local level is characterized by a rigid thermo\textendash visco-plastic constitutive model. Different thermally coupled (non-Newtonian) fluid-like models as Norton\textendash Hoff, Carreau or Sheppard\textendash Wright, among others are tested. To better understand the material flow pattern in the stirring zone, a (Lagrangian based) particle tracing is carried out while post-processing FSW results. A coupling strategy between the analysis of the process zone nearby the pin-tool (local level analysis) and the simulation carried out for the entire structure to be welded (global level analysis) is implemented to accurately predict the temperature histories and, thereby, the residual stresses in FSW.},

  abstract = {Simulation tools are increasingly employed towards quantifying the lifetime of photovoltaic (PV) modules while providing valuable insights into the various failure modes. The use of the finite element method (FEM) in this regard has been especially popular because of its flexibility and the ability to quantify stress levels for a large variety of scenarios ranging from process-induced stress up to field conditions. The thermo-mechanical behaviour of the module or its components is often considered due to the link with common field failures such as cell cracks, interconnection failures, glass fracture, delamination and many others. However, the approaches used, the various inputs considered and the obtained results are highly scattered and sometimes conflicting. This work provides a structured review of the reported simulation approaches and resulting insights obtained through thermo-mechanical finite element simulations on commercial as well as novel PV module technologies. The influence and validity of various inputs such as the used material models, boundary conditions and other assumptions are discussed. Learnings and best practices can be leveraged by future simulations to expand on and accelerate the design-for-reliability capabilities of finite element models for PV modules.},

Combining this heat conduction model and the finite-discrete element method (FDEM), we construct a coupled thermomechanical model for solving thermal cracking problems in brittle materials. The mechanical fracture calculation utilizes virtual joint elements between adjacent solid elements for fracture simulation. On the other hand, virtual joint elements are not included in the heat conduction model to improve numerical efficiency. When new cracks are generated, the node sharing relationship is dynamically updated in the heat conduction calculation to consider the thermal resistance effect of cracks. In this study, the proposed models are verified by simulating heat transfer, coupled thermomechanical, and thermal cracking problems in brittle materials. The numerical simulations are consistent with analytical solutions, and a complex thermal crack process can be realistically captured. These numerical examples verify the correctness of the proposed models, which can be powerful tools for solving heat transfer, coupled thermomechanical, and thermal cracking problems in brittle materials.},

Thermomechanical analysis is critical for EEDs in these applications since excessive heating-induced temperature increase and stress may cause discomfort. An axisymmetric analytical thermomechanical model based on the transfer matrix method, accounting for the coupling between the Fourier heat conduction in the EED and the bio-heat transfer in human skin, the multilayer feature of human skin and the size effect of the heating component in EEDs, is established to study the thermomechanical behavior of the EED/skin system. The predictions of the temperature increase and principle stress from the analytical model agree well with those from finite element analysis (FEA). The influences of various geometric parameters and material properties of the substrate on the maximum principle stress are fully investigated to provide design guidelines for avoiding the adverse thermal effects. The thermal and mechanical comfort analyses are then performed based on the analytical model. These results establish the theoretical foundation for thermomechanical analysis of the EED/skin system.},

The experimental results showed that the compression strength, stiffness, and specific energy absorption increased with the decrease in temperature and with the increase in strain rate. It also showed that, the compressive damage morphologies were sensitive to the change in temperature and strain rate. A coupled thermal-mechanical numerical analysis was conducted to find the thermo/mechanical coupling effect on the compressive crashworthiness of the three-dimensional composite tube. The temperature distributions in the braided preform and the resin during the impact compression were also calculated through finite element analysis. From the finite element analysis results, the inelastic heat generation was seen to be more in the preform than the matrix and its distribution and accumulation led to the damage progress along the loading direction.},

Emphasis is placed on the proper numerical description of fully coupled thermomechanical response on frictional interfaces. From a theoretical standpoint, the first and second laws of thermodynamics are carefully formulated in the context of large deformations, giving rise to a numerical description of contact interaction that is consistent with these laws. Physical observations encompassed by the proposed interface description include thermal softening of frictional response, rate dependence, pressure dependent heat conduction across the interface, and heat sinks on the interfaces created by trapped wear debris. The finite element implementation of the framework is discussed and demonstrated, with numerical examples successfully describing such phenomena as fading braking torque in automobiles and the observed temperature and friction evolution at the interface between a gun barrel and a projectile passing through it. \textcopyright{} 1997 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

The analogy between the proposed formulation in the logarithmic strain space and the geometrically linear theory of plasticity, makes this constitutive framework very transparent and attractive with regard to its numerical formulation. The characteristic strain hardening of the model is derived from a polymer network model. We consider the particularly simple eight chain model, but also comment on the recently developed microsphere model. The viscoplastic flow rule in the logarithmic strain space uses structures of the free volume flow theory, which provides a highly predictive modeling capacity at the onset of viscoplastic flow. The integration of this micromechanically motivated approach into a three-dimensional computational model is a key concern of this work. We outline details of the numerical implementation of this model, including elements such as geometric pre- and post-transformations to/from the logarithmic strain space, a thermomechanical operator split algorithm consisting of an isothermal mechanical predictor followed by a heat conduction corrector and finally, the consistent linearization of the local update algorithm for the dissipative variables as well as its relationship to the global tangent operator. The performance of the proposed formulation is demonstrated by means of a spectrum of numerical examples, which we compare with our experimental findings.},

  abstract = {A recent experiment confirmed that the infrared (IR) local heating method drastically reduces springback of dual-phase (DP) 980 sheets. In the experiment, only the plastic deformation zone of the sheets was locally heated using condensed IR heating. The heated sheets were then deformed by V-bending or 2D-draw bending. Although the experimental observation proved the merit of using the IR local heating to reduce springback, numerical modeling has not been reported. Numerical modeling has been required to predict springback and improve the understanding of the forming process. This paper presents a numerical modeling for V-bending and 2D-draw bending of DP 980 sheets exposed to the IR local heating with the finite element method (FEM). For describing the thermo-mechanical behavior of the DP 980 sheet, a flow stress model which includes a function of temperature and effective plastic strain was newly implemented into Euler-backward stress integration method. The numerical analysis shows that the IR local heating reduces the level of stress in the deformation zone, although it heats only the limited areas, and then it reduces the springback. The simulation also provides a support that the local heating method has an advantage of shape accuracy over the method to heat the material as a whole in V-bending. The simulated results of the springback in both V-bending and 2D-draw bending also show good predictions.},

  abstract = {Coupled-field dynamic problems in mechanics have been traditionally solved by treating the entire system as one computational entity. More recently, increasing attention has been directed to an alternative approach; partition the governing equations into subsystems, which are treated by subsystem analyzers. The selection of the subsystems may be based on weak-coupling considerations, widely different time response characteristics, isolation of nonlinear effects, or more pragmatic reasons such as the availability of analyzer software. In a staggered solution procedure the solution state of the coupled system is advanced by sequentially executing the subsystem analyzers. Subsystem coupling terms are accounted for by temporal extrapolation techniques. This paper focuses on the formulation and computer implementation of staggered solution procedures for two-field problems governed by semidiscrete second-order coupled differential equations. Such equations find application in the modeling of structure-fluid, structure-soil and structure-structure interaction. Following an introductory description of candidate problems and general solution strategies, direct time integration methods are formulated and applied to the coupled system. Staggered solution procedures are constructed through two alternative approaches which are based upon partitioning at the difference and differential equation level, respectively. Characteristic equations that govern the stability of the resulting implementations are derived, and the selection of stable extrapolators discussed. Finally, possible extensions of staggered solution procedures to coupled-field static and eigenvalue problems are suggested.},

  abstract = {Various multifield problems and among them fluid-structure interaction applications arise in nearly all fields of engineering. The present work contributes to the development of a stable and robust approach for the numerical simulation of fluid-structure interaction problems. In particular two-dimensional and three-dimensional elastic structues interacting with incompressible flow are considered. The structural field is governed by the nonlinear elastodynamic equations while the dynamics of the fluid field are described by the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. Both fields are discretised by finite elements in space and finite difference methods in time. An iteratively staggered partitioned coupling procedure with relaxation is applied to obtain the overall coupled solution. This work focuses on methodological aspects and contributes to a deeper understanding of the theoretical foundations of the approach. This is necessary to ensure that the formulation is stable and offers reliable results for a wide range of parameters. In particular the flow solver formulated in an arbitrary Lagrangean Eulerian approach is considered. In addition to the classical conservation laws of mass, linear momentum and energy geometric conservation has to be considered. This is a consequence of the formulation of the flow equations with respect to a moving frame of reference. The relationship of these conservation laws and the stability of the numerical scheme is investigated and stability limits in terms of maximal time step sizes for different formulations are established. It is further shown how an unconditionally stable ALE formulation has to be constructed. Another key issue is the stabilised finite element method employed on the fluid domain. The derivation of the method from a virtual bubble approach is revisited while special attention is turned to the fact that the domain is moving. A version of the stabilisation is derived which is nearly unaffected by the motion of the frame of reference. Further the sensitivity of the stabilised formulation with respect to critical parameters such as very small time steps, steep gradients and distorted meshes is assessed. At least for higher order elements where full consistency of the formulation is assured very accurate results can be obtained on highly distorted meshes. As another main issue the coupling of fluid and structure within a partitioned scheme is considered. A first concern in this context is the exchange of proper coupling data at the interface which is crucial for the consistency of the overall scheme. Subsequently the so-called artificial added mass effect is analysed. This effect is responsible for an inherent instability of sequentially staggered coupling schemes applied to the coupling of lightweight structures and incompressible flow. It is essentially the influence of the incompressibilty which excludes the successful use of simple staggered schemes. The analysis derived in the course of this work reveals why the artificial added mass instability depends upon the mass ratio but further on the specific time discretisation used on the fluid and structural field. In particular it is shown why more accurate temporal discretisation results in an earlier onset of the instability. While the theoretical considerations are accompanied by small numerical examples highlighting particular aspects some larger applications of the method are finally presented. In nahezu allen Bereichen des Ingenieurwesens treten Mehrfeldprobleme auf, zu denen auch Fluid-Struktur-Interaktionen (FSI) zu zahlen sind. Diese Arbeit tragt zur Entwicklung eines stabilen und robusten numerischen Verfahrens zur Losung solcher FSI-Probleme bei. Hier werden speziell zwei- und dreidimensionale Strukturen betrachtet, die in Wechselwirkung mit inkompressiblen Flussigkeiten treten. Dabei ist das Strukturverhalten durch die nichtlinearen Gleichungen der Elastodynamik bestimmt. Die Dynamik des Fluids wird durch die inkompressiblen Navier-Stokes-Gleichungen beschrieben. Beide Felder werden mit Hilfe finiter Elemente im Raum und mittels Differenzenverfahren in der Zeit diskretisiert. Um das gekoppelte Problem zu losen, kommt ein iterativ gestaffeltes partitioniertes Kopplungsverfahren mit Relaxation zum Einsatz. Der Schwerpunkt dieser Arbeit liegt auf methodischen Aspekten. Insbesondere sollen die theoretischen Grundlagen des numerischen Verfahrens verbessert werden. Dabei ist das Ziel sicherzustellen, das das Verfahren stabil lauft und fur einen weiten Parameterbereich Ergebnisse von verlaslicher Genauigkeit liefert. Besondere Aufmerksamkeit gilt dem Fluidloser, der in "Arbitrary Lagrangean Eulerian" (ALE) Betrachtungsweise formuliert ist. Das Verhalten des Fluids wird also in Bezug auf ein bewegtes Koordinatensystem beschrieben. Daher gilt es hier, neben den klassischen Erhaltungssatzen fur Masse, Impuls und Energie auch die geometrische Erhalung zu beachten. Der Zusammenhang zwischen den verschiedenen Erhaltungssatzen und der Stabilitat des numerischen Verfahrens wird untersucht und es konnen Stabilitatsgrenzen in Form von maximalen Zeitschrittweiten fur verschiedene Verfahren angegeben werden. Weiterhin kann gezeigt werden, wie ein unbedingt stabiles ALE Verfahren formuliert werden mus . Ein nachstes Schwerpunktthema ist das stabilisierte Finite-Element-Verfahren auf dem bewegten Gebiet. Es wird eine Version des Stabilisierungsverfahrens hergeleitet, deren Stabilitat von der Netzbewegung nahezu unberuhrt bleibt. Weitere Untersuchungen betreffen die Empfindlichkeit des Verfahrens in Bezug auf kritische Parameter wie sehr kleine Zeitschritte, steile Gradienten oder auch stark verzerrte Netze. Fur Elemente hoherer Ordnung ist das stabilisierte Verfahren vollstandig konsistent. Es wird gezeigt, das mit solchen Elementen auch auf deutlich verzerrten Nezten sehr genaue Ergebnisse erzielt werden konnen. Besonderes Augenmerk wird auch auf die Fluid-Struktur-Kopplung im Rahmen partitionierter Verfahren gelegt. In diesem Zusammenhang betrifft eine erste Frage den Austausch genauer und methodisch konsistenter Kopplungsinformation an der Grenzflache zwischen Fluid und Struktur. Weiterhin wird der sogenannte "artificial added mass effect" analysiert. Dieser Effekt bezeichnet die inherente Instabilitat, die bei sequentiell gestaffelten Verfahren auftritt, wenn leichte Strukturen mit inkompressiblen Fluiden gekoppelt werden. Dabei ist letztendlich die Inkompressibilitat dafur verantwortlich, das einfache sequentiell gestaffelte Verfahren nicht erfolgreich verwendet werden konnen. Die mathematische Analyse, die im Rahmen dieser Arbeit vorgenommen wird, zeigt, warum die Instabilitat nicht nur vom Massenverhaltnis der beteiligten Kontinua, sondern auch von der Zeitdiskretisierung der Felder abhangt. Es wird deutlich, warum genauere zeitliche Diskretisierungsansatze ein fruheres Eintreten der Instabilitat zur Folge haben. Die theoretischen Ergebnisse werden durch begleitende kleine Beispielrechnungen veranschaulicht. Einige grosere Anwendungen des Verfahrens werden am Schlus der Arbeit prasentiert.},

  abstract = {Abstract We present a method with domain decomposition to solve time-dependent non-linear problems. This method enables arbitrary numeric schemes of the Newmark family to be coupled with different time steps in each subdomain: this coupling is achieved by prescribing continuity of velocities at the interface. We are more specifically interested in the coupling of implicit/explicit numeric schemes taking into account material and geometric non-linearities. The interfaces are modelled using a dual Schur formulation where the Lagrange multipliers represent the interfacial forces. Unlike the continuous formulation, the discretized formulation of the dynamic problem is unable to verify simultaneously the continuity of displacements, velocities and accelerations at the interfaces. We show that, within the framework of the Newmark family of numeric schemes, continuity of velocities at the interfaces enables the definition of an algorithm which is stable for all cases envisaged. To prove this stability, we use an energy method, i.e. a global method over the whole time interval, in order to verify the algorithms properties. Then, we propose to extend this to non-linear situations in the following cases: implicit linear/explicit non-linear, explicit non-linear/explicit non-linear and implicit non-linear/explicit non-linear. Finally, we present some examples showing the feasibility of the method. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

However, the implication of the basic postulates and the significance of the related procedure for the development of the constitutive equations is also illustrated in some detail in the context of flow of heat in a rigid solid with particular reference to the propagation of thermal waves at finite speed. More specifically, after briefly examining the nature of the basic equations of motion for a system of particles within the scope of the classical newtonian mechanics, the basic postulates of the purely mechanical theory for a continuum (including its specialization for a rigid body) is re-examined. This includes some differences from the usual procedure on the subject. Next, thermal variables are introduced and after observing a useful analogy between the thermal and mechanical variables, a discussion of a theory of heat (or a purely thermal theory) is provided which differs from the usual development in the classical thermodynamics. A detailed application of the latter development is then made to the problem of heat flow in a stationary rigid solid using several different and well-motivated constitutive equations. Special cases of these include linearized theories of the classical heat flow by conduction and of heat flow transmitted as thermal waves. The remainder of the paper is concerned with thermal mechanical theory of deformable media along with discussions of a number of related issues on the subject.},

The KDC method allows discretizing the temporal direction using relatively large time-steps, making the method very promising for dynamic simulations, particularly when high precision is desired. A multi-domain GFDM scheme is also employed where the composite material considered is decomposed into several sub-domains and, in each sub-domain, the solution is approximated by using the GFDM expansion.

  abstract = {Multibody contact problems are common within the field of multiphysics simulation. Applications involving thermomechanical contact scenarios are also quite prevalent. Such problems can be challenging to solve due to the likelihood of thermal expansion affecting contact geometry which, in turn, can change the thermal behavior of the components being analyzed. This paper explores a simple model of a light water reactor nuclear fuel rod, which consists of cylindrical pellets of uranium dioxide (UO2) fuel sealed within a Zircalloy cladding tube. The tube is initially filled with helium gas, which fills the gap between the pellets and cladding tube. The accurate modeling of heat transfer across the gap between fuel pellets and the protective cladding is essential to understanding fuel performance, including cladding stress and behavior under irradiated conditions, which are factors that affect the lifetime of the fuel. The thermomechanical contact approach developed here is based on the mortar finite element method, where Lagrange multipliers are used to enforce weak continuity constraints at participating interfaces. In this formulation, the heat equation couples to linear mechanics through a thermal expansion term. Lagrange multipliers are used to formulate the continuity constraints for both heat flux and interface traction at contact interfaces. The resulting system of nonlinear algebraic equations are cast in residual form for solution of the transient problem. A Jacobian-free Newton Krylov method is used to provide for fully-coupled solution of the coupled thermal contact and heat equations.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a macroscopic continuum formulation and a numerical analysis of constitutive equations (for stress, entropy and heat flux) describing the thermoelastic behavior of amorphous cross-linked polymers above the glass transition temperature in which a specimen typically `snap-back' with rubbery characteristics. The introduced coupled thermomechanical functional extends the classical strain energy function proposed by Ogden. Volume changes due to thermal expansion are regarded for a large temperature domain and play a remarkable role in thermoelastic materials. The non-linear thermoelastic problem is solved within a staggered (fractional-step) method which is based on a two-phase (isentropic) operator split. Each of the two symmetric sub-problems retains the characteristic dissipative structure of the implicit monolithic scheme which consequently results to an unconditionally stable product formula algorithm. The numerical analysis side shows in particular the capability of the theoretical framework reproducing the realistic physical stress-deformation-temperature relations of rubber. Distinctive attention is paid to the thermoelastic inversion phenomena, a remarkable property governing the class of rubber-like materials.},

  abstract = {Nonlinear Solid Mechanics a Continuum Approach for Engineering Gerhard A. Holzapfel Graz University of Technology, Austria With a modern, comprehensive approach directed towards computational mechanics, this book covers a unique combination of subjects at present unavailable in any other text. It includes vital information on 'variational principles' constituting the cornerstone of the finite element method. In fact this is the only method by which Nonlinear Solid Mechanics is utilized in engineering practice. The book opens with a fundamental chapter on vectors and tensors. The following chapters are based on nonlinear continuum mechanics - an inevitable prerequisite for computational mechanicians. In addition, continuum field theory (applied to a representative sample of hyperelastic materials currently used in nonlinear computations such as incompressible and compressible materials) is presented, as are transversely isotropic materials, composite materials, viscoelastic materials and hyperelastic materials with isotropic damage. Another central chapter is devoted to the thermodynamics of materials, covering both finite thermoelasticity and finite thermoviscoelasticity. Also included are:* an up-to-date list of almost 300 references and a comprehensive index* useful examples and exercises for the student* selected topics of statistical and continuum thermodynamics.Furthermore, the principle of virtual work (in both the material and spatial descriptions) is compared with two and three-field variational principles particularly designed to capture kinematic constraints such as incompressibility. All of the features combined result in an essential text for final year undergraduates, postgraduates and researchers in mechanical, civil and aerospace engineering and applied maths and physics.},

  abstract = {Abstract This study considers the performance of a fully coupled algebraic multilevel preconditioner for Newton\textendash Krylov solution methods. The performance of the preconditioner is demonstrated on a set of challenging multiphysics partial differential equation (PDE) applications: a drift-diffusion approximation for semiconductor devices; a low Mach number formulation for the simulation of coupled flow, transport and non-equilibrium chemical reactions; and a low Mach number formulation for visco-resistive magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) systems. These systems contain multiple physical mechanisms that are strongly coupled, highly nonlinear, non-symmetric and produce solutions with multiple length- and time-scales. In the context of this study the governing PDEs for these systems are discretized in space by a stabilized finite element (FE) method that collocates all unknowns at each node of the FE mesh. The algebraic multilevel preconditioner is based on an aggressive-coarsening graph-partitioning of the non-zero block structure of the Jacobian matrix. The performance of the algebraic multilevel preconditioner is compared with a standard variable overlap additive Schwarz domain decomposition preconditioner. Representative performance and parallel scaling results are presented for a set of direct-to-steady-state and fully implicit transient solutions. The performance studies include parallel weak scaling studies on up to 4096 cores and also includes the solution of systems as large as two billion unknowns carried out on 24000 cores of a Cray XT3/4. In general, the results of this study indicate that on this reasonably diverse set of challenging multiphysics applications the algebraic multilevel preconditioner performs very well.

The physical model is restricted to Biot's theory of single-phase flow and linear poroelasticity, but is sufficiently general to be extended to multiphase flow problems and inelastic behavior. The distinctive technical aspects of our approach are: (1) the space discretization of the equations. The unknown variables are the pressure, the fluid velocity, and the rock displacements. We recognize that these variables are of very different nature, and need to be discretized differently. We propose a mixed finite element space discretization, which is stable, convergent, locally mass conservative, and employs a single computational grid. To ensure stability and robustness, we perform an implicit time integration of the fluid flow equations. (2) The strategies for the solution of the coupled system. We compare different solution strategies, including the fully coupled approach, the usual (conditionally stable) iteratively coupled approach, and a less common unconditionally stable sequential scheme. We show that the latter scheme corresponds to a modified block Jacobi method, which also enjoys improved convergence properties. This computational model has been implemented in an object-oriented reservoir simulator, whose modular design allows for further extensions and enhancements. We show several representative numerical simulations that illustrate the effectiveness of the approach.},

  abstract = {Abstract We perform a stability and convergence analysis of sequential methods for coupled flow and geomechanics, in which the mechanics sub-problem is solved first. We consider slow deformations, so that inertia is negligible and the mechanical problem is governed by an elliptic equation. We use Biot's self-consistent theory to obtain the classical parabolic-type flow problem. We use a generalized midpoint rule (parameter {$\alpha$} between 0 and 1) time discretization, and consider two classical sequential methods: the drained and undrained splits. The von Neumann method provides sharp stability estimates for the linear poroelasticity problem. The drained split with backward Euler time discretization ( {$\alpha$} = 1) is conditionally stable, and its stability depends only on the coupling strength, and it is independent of time step size. The drained split with the midpoint rule ( {$\alpha$} = 0.5) is unconditionally unstable. The mixed time discretization, with {$\alpha$} = 1.0 for mechanics and {$\alpha$} = 0.5 for flow, has the same stability properties as the backward Euler scheme. The von Neumann method indicates that the undrained split is unconditionally stable when {$\alpha$} {$\geqslant$} 0.5. We extend the stability analysis to the nonlinear regime (poro-elastoplasticity) via the energy method. It is well known that the drained split does not inherit the contractivity property of the continuum problem, thereby precluding unconditional stability. For the undrained split we show that it is B-stable (therefore unconditionally stable at the algorithmic level) when {$\alpha$} {$\geqslant$} 0.5. We also analyze convergence of the drained and undrained splits, and derive the a priori error estimates from matrix algebra and spectral analysis. We show that the drained split with a fixed number of iterations is not convergent even when it is stable. The undrained split with a fixed number of iterations is convergent for a compressible system (i.e., finite Biot modulus). For a nearly-incompressible system (i.e., very large Biot modulus), the undrained split loses first-order accuracy, and becomes non-convergent in time. We also study the rate of convergence of both splits when they are used in a fully-iterated sequential scheme. When the medium permeability is high or the time step size is large, which corresponds to a high diffusion of pressure, the error amplification of the drained split is lower and therefore converges faster than the undrained split. The situation is reversed in the case of low permeability and small time step size. We provide numerical experiments supporting all the stability and convergence estimates of the drained and undrained splits, in the linear and nonlinear regimes. We also show that our spatial discretization (finite volumes for flow and finite elements for mechanics) removes the well-documented spurious instability in consolidation problems at early times.},

We employ the von Neumann and energy methods for linear and nonlinear problems, respectively. We consider two sequential methods with the generalized midpoint rule for tn+{$\alpha$}, where {$\alpha$} is the parameter of time discretization: namely, the fixed-strain and fixed-stress splits. The von Neumann method indicates that the fixed-strain split is only conditionally stable, and that its stability limit is a coupling strength less than unity if {$\alpha$} {$\geqslant$} 0.5. On the other hand, the fixed-stress split is unconditionally stable when {$\alpha$} {$\geqslant$} 0.5, the amplification factors of the fixed-stress split are different from those of the undrained split and are identical to the fully coupled method. Unconditional stability of the fixed-stress split is also obtained from the energy method for poroelastoplasticity. We show that the fixed-stress split is contractive and B-stable when {$\alpha$} {$\geqslant$} 0.5. We also estimate the convergence behaviors for the two sequential methods by the matrix based and spectral analyses for the backward Euler method in time. From the estimates, the fixed-strain split may not be convergent with a fixed number of iterations particularly around the stability limit even though it is stable. The fixed-stress split, however, is convergent for a fixed number of iterations, showing better accuracy than the undrained split. Even when we cannot obtain the exact local bulk modulus (or exact rock compressibility) at the flow step a priori due to complex boundary conditions or the nonlinearity of the materials, the fixed-stress split can still provide stability and convergence by an appropriate estimation of the local bulk modulus, such as the dimension-based estimation, by which the employed local bulk modulus is less stiff than the exact local bulk modulus. We provide numerical examples supporting all the estimates of stability and convergence for the fixed-strain and fixed-stress splits.},

  abstract = {In the present work the problem of fluid\textendash structure interaction (FSI) with independently space discretized fluid and structure fields is addressed in the context of finite elements. To be able to deal with non-conforming meshes at the fluid\textendash structure interface, we propose the integration of a dual mortar method into the general FSI framework. This method has lately been used successfully to impose interface constraints in other contexts such as finite deformation contact. The main focus is set on monolithic coupling algorithms for FSI here. In these cases the dual mortar approach allows for the elimination of the additional Lagrange multiplier degrees of freedom from the global system by condensation. The resulting system matrices have the same block structure as their counterparts for the conforming case and permit the same numerical treatment. Partitioned Dirichlet\textendash Neumann coupling is also considered briefly and it is shown that the dual mortar approach permits a numerically efficient mapping between fluid and structure quantities at the interface. Numerical examples demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of the proposed method. We present results for a variety of different element formulations for the fluid and the structure field, indicating that the proposed method is not limited to any specific formulation. Furthermore, the applicability of state-of-the-art iterative solvers is considered and the convergence behavior is shown to be comparable to standard simulations with conforming discretizations at the interface.},

Coupled problems occur in a wide range of engineering applications, and their numerical treatment has recently gained much attention. We advocate a partitioned solution approach that enables the use of different discretization schemes and different solvers for the individual fields. Highly optimized, existing solvers can thus be reused\textemdash which enhances modularity, reusability, and performance. However, depending on the problem at hand, appropriate measures must be taken to stabilize the solution process and accelerate its convergence. In addition, the field quantities of interest need to be transferred between the solvers. To this end, we developed the software framework comana, which facilitates the implementation of different coupling strategies for a vast range of multifield problems. Interaction with the solvers is achieved through a uniform interface to the solvers' databases. Interfaces for solvers for which there is no interface available yet can be implemented with minimum effort.},

Recently, the combination of thermodynamically based stability estimates and energy-momentum numerical approaches has proven to be useful in developing effective, unconditionally stable algorithms for mechanical contact/impact in the fully nonlinear regime. In this paper, these ideas are extended to coupled interface problems, by developing a new a priori stability estimate for the fully coupled thermomechanical contact problem in large deformations. The model framework encompasses inelastic heating and thermal softening within the contacting bodies, as well as frictional heating and thermal softening of the coefficient of friction on sliding interfaces. Also incorporated are pressure dependent heat transfer across these interfaces, and a fully coupled treatment of the conductive heat transfer occurring within the bodies. Use of the stability estimate to extend energy-momentum approaches to dissipative and thermally coupled phenomena is discussed, as is the development of an unconditionally stable adiabatic split of the coupled problem. The latter is shown to be useful in developing partitioned integration schemes for the coupled equations of evolution.},

  abstract = {A recent experiment confirmed that the infrared (IR) local heating method drastically reduces springback of dual-phase (DP) 980 sheets. In the experiment, only the plastic deformation zone of the sheets was locally heated using condensed IR heating. The heated sheets were then deformed by V-bending or 2D-draw bending. Although the experimental observation proved the merit of using the IR local heating to reduce springback, numerical modeling has not been reported. Numerical modeling has been required to predict springback and improve the understanding of the forming process. This paper presents a numerical modeling for V-bending and 2D-draw bending of DP 980 sheets exposed to the IR local heating with the finite element method (FEM). For describing the thermo-mechanical behavior of the DP 980 sheet, a flow stress model which includes a function of temperature and effective plastic strain was newly implemented into Euler-backward stress integration method. The numerical analysis shows that the IR local heating reduces the level of stress in the deformation zone, although it heats only the limited areas, and then it reduces the springback. The simulation also provides a support that the local heating method has an advantage of shape accuracy over the method to heat the material as a whole in V-bending. The simulated results of the springback in both V-bending and 2D-draw bending also show good predictions.},

  abstract = {A comprehensive computational framework based on the finite element method for the simulation of coupled hygro-thermo-mechanical problems in photovoltaic laminates is herein proposed. While the thermo-mechanical problem takes place in the three-dimensional space of the laminate, moisture diffusion occurs in a two-dimensional domain represented by the polymeric layers and by the vertical channel cracks in the solar cells. Therefore, a geometrical multi-scale solution strategy is pursued by solving the partial differential equations governing heat transfer and thermo-elasticity in the three-dimensional space, and the partial differential equation for moisture diffusion in the two dimensional domains. By exploiting a staggered scheme, the thermo-mechanical problem is solved first via a fully implicit solution scheme in space and time, with a specific treatment of the polymeric layers as zero-thickness interfaces whose constitutive response is governed by a novel thermo-visco-elastic cohesive zone model based on fractional calculus. Temperature and relative displacements along the domains where moisture diffusion takes place are then projected to the finite element model of diffusion, coupled with the thermo-mechanical problem by the temperature and crack opening dependent diffusion coefficient. The application of the proposed method to photovoltaic modules pinpoints two important physical aspects: (i) moisture diffusion in humidity freeze tests with a temperature dependent diffusivity is a much slower process than in the case of a constant diffusion coefficient; (ii) channel cracks through Silicon solar cells significantly enhance moisture diffusion and electric degradation, as confirmed by experimental tests.},

Thermomechanical analysis is critical for EEDs in these applications since excessive heating-induced temperature increase and stress may cause discomfort. An axisymmetric analytical thermomechanical model based on the transfer matrix method, accounting for the coupling between the Fourier heat conduction in the EED and the bio-heat transfer in human skin, the multilayer feature of human skin and the size effect of the heating component in EEDs, is established to study the thermomechanical behavior of the EED/skin system. The predictions of the temperature increase and principle stress from the analytical model agree well with those from finite element analysis (FEA). The influences of various geometric parameters and material properties of the substrate on the maximum principle stress are fully investigated to provide design guidelines for avoiding the adverse thermal effects. The thermal and mechanical comfort analyses are then performed based on the analytical model. These results establish the theoretical foundation for thermomechanical analysis of the EED/skin system.},

The interplay between mechanics and FDG-metabolic activity was analyzed in terms of maximum values and the three-dimensional spatial relationship, respectively. Fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT) data sets of n = 18 AAA patients were studied. Maximum FDG-uptake (SUV max ) in the AAA wall varied from 1.32 to 4.60 (average SUV max 3.31 {$\pm$} 0.87). Maximum wall stresses and strains ranged from 10.0 to 64.0 N/cm(2) (38.2 {$\pm$} 13.8\, N/cm(2)) and from 0.190 to 0.260 (0.222 {$\pm$} 0.023), respectively. SUV max was significantly correlated to maximum wall stress and strain (SUV max to stress: r = 0.71, p = 0.0005; SUV max to strain: r = 0.66, p = 0.0013). To evaluate the three-dimensional spatial interaction between FDG-uptake and acting wall stress, element-wise correlations were performed. In all but 2 AAAs, positive element-wise correlation of FDG-uptake to wall stress was obtained, with the Pearson's correlation coefficient ranging from -0.168 to 0.738 ( 0.372 {$\pm$} 0.263). The results indicate that mechanical stresses are correlated quantitatively and spatially to FDG-uptake in the AAA wall. It is hypothesized that unphysiologically increased loading in the AAA wall triggers biological tissue reaction, such as inflammation or regenerative processes, causing elevated FDG-metabolic activity.

The proposed strategy is based on the isothermal split methodology, i.e. the mechanical problem is solved at constant temperature and the thermal problem is solved for a fixed configuration. Nevertheless,the procedure for this strategy is divided into two phases within each increment: the prediction and the correction phases, while the interchange of information is performed on both. This allows takingadvantage of automatic time-step control techniques, previously implemented for the mechanicalproblem, which is the main feature that distinguishes it from the classical strategies. The aim of the proposed strategy is to reduce the computational cost without compromising the accuracy of the results. The new coupling strategy is validated using three numerical examples, comparing its accuracy and performance with the ones obtained with the classical (commonly employed) strategies for solving thermomechanical problems. Moreover, the influence of the time-step size on the accuracy is analysed. The results indicate that the proposed strategy presents accuracy close to the one obtained with the implicit coupling algorithm, while the computational cost is only slightly higher than the one required by the explicit strategy.},

This work presents a finite element model for the analysis of thermal contact, which takes into account the effect of contact pressure and gap dimension in the heat flow across the interface between two bodies. Additionally, the frictional heat generation is also addressed, which is dictated by the contact forces predicted by the mechanical problem. The frictional contact problem and thermal problem are formulated in the frame of the finite element method. A new law is proposed to define the interfacial heat transfer coefficient (IHTC) as a function of the contact pressure and gap distance, enabling a smooth transition between two contact status (gap and contact). The staggered scheme used as coupling strategy to solve the thermomechanical problem is briefly presented. Four numerical examples are presented to validate the finite element model and highlight the importance of the proposed law on the predicted temperature.},

We address this issue by combining them with an additional additive Schwarz preconditioner, whose subdomains span across the interface on purpose. By performing cheap but accurate subdomain solves that do not depend on the separation of physical fields, this error accumulation can be reduced effectively. Numerical experiments compare the performance of the hybrid preconditioner to existing approaches, demonstrate the increased efficiency, and study its parallel performance.},

The independent choice of time integration schemes is achieved by temporal consistent interpolation of the interface traction. To reduce computational costs, we introduce the possibility of field specific predictors in both structure and fluid field. These predictors act on the single fields only. Possible violations of the interface coupling conditions during the predictor step are dealt with within the monolithic solution procedure. We present full details of such a generalized monolithic solution procedure, which is fully consistent in its nonconforming temporal and spatial discretization. The incorporated mortar approach allows for nonmatching spatial discretizations of the fluid and solid domain at the fluid-structure interface and is fully integrated in the resulting monolithic system of equations. The method is applied to a variety of numerical examples. Thereby, temporal convergence rates, the special role of essential boundary conditions at the fluid-structure interface, and the positive effect of predictors are demonstrated and discussed. Emphasis is put on the comparison of different time integration schemes in fluid and structure field, for what the achieved freedom of choice of time integrators is fully exploited.},

  abstract = {Numerical simulation of fluid\textendash structure interactions has typically been done using partitioned solution methods. However, partitioned methods are inherently non-conservative and generally numerically unstable. The deficiencies of partitioned methods have motivated the investigation of monolithic solution methods. Conservation is possible for monolithic methods, the conditions have recently been presented [E.H. van Brummelen, S.J. Hulshoff, R. de Borst, Energy conservation under incompatibility for fluid\textendash structure interaction problems, Comput. Methods Appl. Mech. Engrg. 192 (2003) 2727\textendash 2748]. In the present paper we investigate the relevance of maintaining conservation for a model fluid\textendash structure interaction problem, viz., the piston problem. To distinguish the effect of the error induced by the interface coupling from the fluid and structure discretization errors, we use fluid subcycling and an exact time-integration method for the structure. A comparison between conservative and non-conservative monolithic methods as well as partitioned methods is made. We show that maintaining conservation has considerable impact on the stability and accuracy of the numerical method. These results also indicate that only for a conservative monolithic scheme the improvement in accuracy over partitioned methods warrants the computational cost associated with a monolithic solution. Moreover, we illustrate the implications that particular combinations of fluid and structure discretizations can have on the conservation properties of the fluid\textendash structure interaction problem.},

In contrast to existing kinematical approaches to finite plasticity of glassy polymers, the formulation applies a plastic metric theory based on an additive split of Lagrangian Hencky-type strains into elastic and plastic parts. The analogy between the proposed formulation in the logarithmic strain space and the geometrically linear theory of plasticity, makes this constitutive framework very transparent and attractive with regard to its numerical formulation. The characteristic strain hardening of the model is derived from a polymer network model. We consider the particularly simple eight chain model, but also comment on the recently developed microsphere model. The viscoplastic flow rule in the logarithmic strain space uses structures of the free volume flow theory, which provides a highly predictive modeling capacity at the onset of viscoplastic flow. The integration of this micromechanically motivated approach into a three-dimensional computational model is a key concern of this work. We outline details of the numerical implementation of this model, including elements such as geometric pre- and post-transformations to/from the logarithmic strain space, a thermomechanical operator split algorithm consisting of an isothermal mechanical predictor followed by a heat conduction corrector and finally, the consistent linearization of the local update algorithm for the dissipative variables as well as its relationship to the global tangent operator. The performance of the proposed formulation is demonstrated by means of a spectrum of numerical examples, which we compare with our experimental findings.},

Following this fundamental assumption, we derive a consistent internal variable formulation of thermoplasticity in a Lagrangian as well as a Eulerian geometric setting. On the numerical side, we discuss in detail an objective integration algorithm for the mixed-variant plastic flow rule. The special feature here is a new representation of the stress return and the algorithmic elastoplastic moduli in the eigenvalue space of the Eulerian plastic metric for plane problems. Furthermore, an algorithm for the solution of the coupled problem is formulated based on an operator split of the global field equations of thermoplasticity.

The development of reusable hypersonic cruise vehicles requires analysis capability that can capture the coupled, highly-nonlinear interactions between the fluid flow, structural mechanics, and structural heat transfer. This coupled analysis must also be performed over significant portions of the flight trajectory due to the long-term thermal evolution of the vehicle. The fluid and structural physics operate at significantly smaller time scales than the thermal evolution, requiring time marching that can capture the small time scales for time records that encapsulate the longer time scale of the thermal response. This leads to extreme computational times and motivates research that seeks to maximize efficiency of the time integrations for the coupled problem. The goal of this dissertation is to develop time integration procedures that significantly improve computational efficiency while also maintaining time accuracy},

  abstract = {This article addresses a thermo-mechanically coupled problem of thermo-viscoelasticity at finite strains using a monolithic approach. The underlying equations are based on the non-linear transient heat equation, the local equilibrium conditions and the evolution equations of the internal variables. The latter describe the hardening behavior of the material. If the method of vertical lines is applied, its first step\textendash namely the spatial discretization\textendash yields a system of differential-algebraic equations (DAE-system). Here, we employ the p-version of the finite element method based on integrated Legendre polynomials. This can lead to very precise solutions in the spatial domain. In order to be accurate in the time-domain as well, stiffly accurate, diagonally-implicit Runge\textendash Kutta methods are applied to solve the DAE-system yielding a coupled system of non-linear algebraic equations. In this article, the system is solved monolithically by employing the Multilevel-Newton algorithm. Accordingly, a high-order result is obtained in the space and the time domain. The numerical concept is applied to a constitutive model of finite strain thermo-viscoelasticity. Several examples are applied to demonstrate the efficiency and applicability of the numerical scheme. It is especially the transient problems that call for time-adaptive schemes which are naturally embedded in the concept.},

  abstract = {Simulation tools are increasingly employed towards quantifying the lifetime of photovoltaic (PV) modules while providing valuable insights into the various failure modes. The use of the finite element method (FEM) in this regard has been especially popular because of its flexibility and the ability to quantify stress levels for a large variety of scenarios ranging from process-induced stress up to field conditions. The thermo-mechanical behaviour of the module or its components is often considered due to the link with common field failures such as cell cracks, interconnection failures, glass fracture, delamination and many others. However, the approaches used, the various inputs considered and the obtained results are highly scattered and sometimes conflicting. This work provides a structured review of the reported simulation approaches and resulting insights obtained through thermo-mechanical finite element simulations on commercial as well as novel PV module technologies. The influence and validity of various inputs such as the used material models, boundary conditions and other assumptions are discussed. Learnings and best practices can be leveraged by future simulations to expand on and accelerate the design-for-reliability capabilities of finite element models for PV modules.},

  abstract = {Many problems of interest, particularly in the nuclear engineering field, involve coupling between the thermal and mechanical response of an engineered system. The strength of the two-way feedback between the thermal and mechanical solution fields can vary significantly depending on the problem. Contact problems exhibit a particularly high degree of two-way feedback between those fields. This paper describes and demonstrates the application of a flexible simulation environment that permits the solution of coupled physics problems using either a tightly coupled approach or a loosely coupled approach. In the tight coupling approach, Newton iterations include the coupling effects between all physics, while in the loosely coupled approach, the individual physics models are solved independently, and fixed-point iterations are performed until the coupled system is converged. These approaches are applied to simple demonstration problems and to realistic nuclear engineering applications. The demonstration problems consist of single and multi-domain thermomechanics with and without thermal and mechanical contact. Simulations of a reactor pressure vessel under pressurized thermal shock conditions and a simulation of light water reactor fuel are also presented. Problems that include thermal and mechanical contact, such as the contact between the fuel and cladding in the fuel simulation, exhibit much stronger two-way feedback between the thermal and mechanical solutions, and as a result, are better solved using a tight coupling strategy.},

  abstract = {In this work, a combined theoretical and numerical approach is taken to consider the dynamic behaviour and the thermomechanical interactions of systems in which friction has an important role. Emphasis is placed on the proper numerical description of fully coupled thermomechanical response on frictional interfaces. From a theoretical standpoint, the first and second laws of thermodynamics are carefully formulated in the context of large deformations, giving rise to a numerical description of contact interaction that is consistent with these laws. Physical observations encompassed by the proposed interface description include thermal softening of frictional response, rate dependence, pressure dependent heat conduction across the interface, and heat sinks on the interfaces created by trapped wear debris. The finite element implementation of the framework is discussed and demonstrated, with numerical examples successfully describing such phenomena as fading braking torque in automobiles and the observed temperature and friction evolution at the interface between a gun barrel and a projectile passing through it. \textcopyright{} 1997 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Such an implementation is herein called a staggered solution strategy. The conventional realization of this strategy is handicapped, however, by severe temporal stepsize limitations. Several stabilized formulations are introduced, which circumvent such limitations and achieve unconditional stability for certain extrapolators. It should be noted that these stabilization techniques are applicable to other interaction problems governed by similar coupled field equations.},

We present a mathematical framework for assessing some important numerical properties of the chosen partitioned procedure, and predicting its performance for realistic applications. Our analysis framework is based on the estimation of the energy that is artificially introduced at the fluid/structure interface by the staggering process that is inherent to most partitioned solution methods. This framework also suggests alternative approaches for time-discretizing the transfer of aerodynamic data from the fluid subsystem to the structure subsystem that improves the accuracy and the stability properties of the underlying partitioned method. We apply this framework to the analysis of several partitioned procedures that have been previously proposed for the solution of nonlinear transient aeroelastic problems. Using two- and three-dimensional, transonic and supersonic, wing and panel aeroelastic applications, we validate this framework and highlight its impact on the design and selection of a staggering algorithm for the solution of coupled fluid/structure equations.},

First, we develop the entire system of differential\textendash algebraic equations resulting from the spatially discretized principle of virtual displacements, the principle of virtual temperatures, and the evolution equations of the internal variables provided by the constitutive model. In the time-integration step this system is solved both using a fully monolithic approach based on a Backward\textendash Euler scheme in combination with the Multilevel-Newton algorithm as well as a partitioned approach solving the fully coupled system. The latter is treated by means of a combination of a Backward\textendash Euler method and an accelerated Gauss\textendash Seidel/Multilevel-Newton scheme to solve the resulting system of algebraic equations within each time-integration step. Additionally, we consider a specific treatment of the interpolation between different meshes within the partitioned approach. This is shown for p-version finite elements based on hierarchical shape functions. Finally, it turns out that the specific constitutive model of small-strain thermo-viscoplasticity, which is based on the decomposition into kinematic hardening and energy storing strains, yields a problem-adapted stress algorithm. This allows to reduce the stress algorithm on Gauss-point level to the solution of one scalar equation. Numerical examples serve to elucidate the behavior and properties of the proposed methods.},

A key feature is the reformulation of all involved inequality constraints, namely those of Hill's orthotropic yield criterion as well as the normal and tangential contact constraints, in terms of non-smooth nonlinear complementarity functions. Using a consistent linearization, this system of equations can be solved with a non-smooth variant of Newton's method. A quadrature point-wise decoupled plastic constraint enforcement and the use of so-called dual basis functions in the mortar contact formulation allow for a condensation of all additionally introduced variables, thus resulting in an efficient formulation that contains discrete displacement and temperature degrees of freedom only, while, at the same time, an exact constraint enforcement is assured. Numerical examples from thermo-plasticity, thermo-elastic frictional contact and thermo-elasto-plastic frictional contact demonstrate the wide range of applications covered by the presented method.},

The required penalty parameter is estimated with local generalized eigenvalue problems, based on which an additional harmonic weighting of the boundary traction is introduced. A special focus is put on the enforcement of the thermal constraints at the contact interface, namely heat conduction and frictional heating. Two numerical methods to introduce these effects are presented, a substitution method as well as a Nitsche-type approach.

The discussion considers the implementation of a stabilized FE formulation in context of a fully-implicit time integration and direct-to-steady-state solution capability. The nonlinear solver strategy employs Newton\textendash Krylov methods, which are preconditioned using fully-coupled algebraic multilevel preconditioners. These preconditioners are shown to enable a robust, scalable and efficient solution approach for the large-scale sparse linear systems generated by the Newton linearization. Verification results demonstrate the expected order-of-accuracy for the stabilized FE discretization. The approach is tested on a variety of prototype problems, including both low-Lundquist number (e.g., an MHD Faraday conduction pump and a hydromagnetic Rayleigh\textendash Bernard linear stability calculation) and moderately-high Lundquist number (magnetic island coalescence problem) examples. Initial results that explore the scaling of the solution methods are presented on up to 4096 processors for problems with up to 64M unknowns on a CrayXT3/4. Additionally, a large-scale proof-of-capability calculation for 1 billion unknowns for the MHD Faraday pump problem on 24,000 cores is presented.},

In particular, the algorithmic elastoplastic tangent moduli of the infinitesimal theory remain unchanged. For the static problem, the proposed class of algorithms preserve exactly plastic volume changes if the yield criterion is pressure insensitive. For the dynamic problem, a class of time-stepping algorithms is presented which inherits exactly the conservation laws of total linear and angular momentum.

An appropriate framework for constitutive modelling is introduced that includes a stress-free thermally expanded configuration and a plastically deformed unstressed damaged configuration. A two-level iterative scheme is employed at each time increment to solve the field equations governing the conservation of momentum (mechanical step) and the conservation of energy (thermal step) for the coupled thermo-mechanical problem. Exact linearizations for the calculation of the tangent stiffness are performed in each of these solution steps. A fully implicit, thermo-mechanically coupled and incrementally objective Euler-backward radial return based map is developed for the time integration of the constitutive equations. The present model is used to analyse a number of benchmark examples including metal forming processes wherein temperature and the accumulated damage play an important role in influencing the deformation mechanism and the nature of the deformed workpiece.

  abstract = {The calculation of viscous flows inside deformable structures faces major difficulties when enforcing the kinematic compatibility at the fluid structure interface and updating the geometry of the domain. This paper proposes to overcome these problems by considering the fluid and the structure as a unique continuous medium, to be studied in a fixed reference configuration. The resulting problem is then split into a fluid and a structural part through an additive decomposition of the space of kinematically admissible test functions. This approach treats the structure in a fully Lagrangian way and uses an associated arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) formulation for the fluid. Such a strategy has three advantages which are detailed in the present paper. \textbullet{} it can be discretised in time by implicit, stable, energy conserving time integration schemes, and solved by simple, iterative uncoupled algorithms; \textbullet{} the fluid and the structural problems can be approximated by independent finite element spaces; \textbullet{} the most recent geometrically exact nonlinear shell models can be used for the structures. The full strategy has been implemented into an industrial CFD code. Results obtained in the simulation of industrial hydraulic shock absorbers are presented at the end of the paper.},

  abstract = {Although the issues are not very controversial, the fusion of both the fields of heat conduction in solids and elasticity which results in the so-called field of dynamic thermoelasticity (both non-classical and classical), dates as far back as Maxwell (1867), and has long been a subject matter of widespread research activity and interest. Although routine thermomechanical problems are primarily influenced by classical effects, issues where non-classical influences may become important are also addressed. To date, numerous applications ranging from defense, aerospace to manufacturing related problems including routine mechanical, civil, nuclear and allied engineering applications influenced by thermal-structural interactions continue to pose significant challenges both from the underlying mechanics and from a computational viewpoint. Herein is first presented an overview of non-classical and classical dynamic thermoelasticity models and equations governing these situations. Subsequently, attention is focused on computational approaches for the modeling and analysis of various classes of problems encompassing thermal-structural interactions which can be broadly classified as: i) thermally-induced stress wave propagation problems, ii) thermally-induced dynamic (inertial type) problems, and iii) the general field of thermal stresses. A variety of illustrative numerical examples encompassing non-classical and classical influences are finally presented to provide an improved understanding of the behavior of thermal-structural problems via effective unified computational developments.

It is found that as the total amount of cold work which has been done on a specimen increases the proportion which is absorbed decreases. Though saturation was not fully reached even with twisted rods, curves representing the experimental results for copper indicate that it would have been reached at a plastic strain very little greater than the strain at fracture. The amount of cold work necessary to saturate copper with latent energy at 15\textdegree{} C. is thus found to be slightly greater than 14 calories per gram. By using compression instead of torsion, it was found possible to do much more cold work on copper than this, and compression tests revealed the fact that the compressive stress increases with increasing strain till the total applied cold work was equivalent to 15 calories per gram. No further rise in compressive stress occurred with further compression even though the specimen was compressed till its height was only 1/53rd of its original height.},

  abstract = {A computational homogenization framework is developed in the context of the thermomechanical contact of two boundary layers with microscopically rough surfaces. The major goal is to accurately capture the temperature jump across the macroscopic interface in the finite deformation regime with finite deviations from the equilibrium temperature. Motivated by the limit of scale separation, a two-phase thermomechanically decoupled methodology is introduced, wherein a purely mechanical contact problem is followed by a purely thermal one. In order to correctly take into account finite size effects that are inherent to the problem, this algorithmically consistent two-phase framework is cast within a self-consistent iterative scheme that acts as a first-order corrector. For a comparison with alternative coupled homogenization frameworks as well as for numerical validation, a mortar-based thermomechanical contact algorithm is introduced. This algorithm is uniformly applicable to all orders of isogeometric discretizations through non-uniform rational B-spline basis functions. Overall, the two-phase approach combined with the mortar contact algorithm delivers a computational framework of optimal efficiency that can accurately represent the geometry of smooth surface textures.

  abstract = {A homogenization framework is developed for determining the complete macroscopic thermomechanical sliding contact response of soft interfaces with microscopic roughness. To this end, a micro\textendash macro mechanical dissipation equality is first established which enables defining a macroscopic frictional traction. The derivation allows both contacting bodies to be deformable, thereby extending the commonly adopted setting where one of the bodies is rigid. Moreover, it forms a basis for the second step, where a novel micro\textendash macro thermal dissipation equality is established which enables defining partitioning coefficients that are associated with the frictional dissipation as it is perceived on the macroscale. Finally, a comparison of the temperature fields from the original heterogeneous thermomechanical contact problem and an idealized homogeneous one reveals an identification of the macroscopic temperature jump. The computational implementation of the framework is carried out within an incrementally two-phase micromechanical test which delivers a well-defined macroscopic response that is not influenced by purely algorithmic choices such as the duration of sliding. Two-dimensional numerical investigations on periodic and random samples from thermo-viscoelastic boundary layers with unilateral and bilateral roughness demonstrate the temperature\textendash velocity\textendash pressure dependence of the macroscopic contact response.},

The overall homogenization framework transfers macroscopic contact variables, such as surfacial stretch, pressure and heat flux, as boundary conditions on a test sample within a micromechanical interface testing procedure. An analysis of the thermal dissipation within the test sample reveals a thermodynamically consistent identification for the macroscopic thermal contact conductance parameter that enables the solution of a homogenized thermomechanical contact boundary value problem based on standard computational approaches. The homogenized contact response effectively predicts a temperature jump across the macroscale contact interface. The strong dependence of this homogenized response on macroscale solution variables of interest is demonstrated via representative three-dimensional numerical investigations. The proposed contact homogenization framework is suitable for the analysis of similar energy transport phenomena across heterogeneous contact interfaces where the investigation of the sources for energy dissipation is of concern.

The framework is composed by promising application-specific preconditioners presented previously in the literature with the common feature that they are able to be implemented for a generic coupled problem, involving an arbitrary number of fields, and to be used to solve a variety of applications. The first selected preconditioner is based on a generic block Gauss\textendash Seidel iteration for uncoupling the fields, and standard algebraic multigrid (AMG) methods for solving the resulting uncoupled problems. The second preconditioner is based on the semi-implicit method for pressure-linked equations (SIMPLE) which is extended here to deal with an arbitrary number of fields, and also results in uncoupled problems that can be solved with standard AMG. Finally, a more sophisticated preconditioner is considered which enforces the coupling at all AMG levels, in contrast to the other two techniques which resolve the coupling only at the finest level. Our purpose is to show that these methods perform satisfactory in quite different scenarios apart from their original applications. To this end, we consider three very different coupled problems: thermo-structure interaction, fluid\textendash structure interaction and a complex model of the human lung. Numerical results show that these general purpose methods are efficient and scalable in this range of applications.},

The possibility of prospective energy conversion means, have additionally been added to the cause of researching about these materials. Therefore, the review presented here may be considered as a topical discussion on MEE materials and structures. Through this paper, all critical concepts revolving around MEE materials are discussed in separate sections ranging from the very definition of MEE materials, their material phenomenon, types and properties, to certain fundamental theories and micromechanical models, structural analyses of MEE structures and their nano-sized counterparts, effects of various external and internal parameters and prospective applications of these materials. The present study is in no ways exhaustive to the methods and results observed, but it may be considered as a guide to researchers and scholars about the behavior of MEE materials, wherein critical observations and analyses' techniques are discussed.},

One wide spread and complex FSI-subclass is the category that studies the instationary behavior of incompressible viscous flows and thin-walled structures exhibiting large deformations. Free surfaces often present an essential additional challenge for this class of problems. Prominent application areas are fluid sloshing in tanks and numerable problems in offshore engineering and naval architecture. Especially when partitioned strong coupling schemes are used in order to solve the coupled FSI problem the design of an appropriate overall computational approach including free surface effects is not trivial. In this paper a new so-called partitioned implicit free surface approach is introduced and embedded into a strong coupling FSI solver. For complex problem classes this approach is combined with the general elevation equation that is closed through a dimensionally reduced pseudo-structural approach. The presented approach shows the same stability properties as a full implicit approach but is by far more efficient\textemdash especially in the partitioned coupled case.},

One of the main goals is to take advantage of the flexibility of the partitioned approach to enable combinations of different simulation software and solvers. Within the frame of this article, we limit ourselves to the case of nonlinear thermoelasticity at finite strains, using temperature-dependent material parameters. For the thermal radiation field, diffuse radiating surfaces and gray participating media are assumed. Moreover, we present a robust and fast partitioned coupling strategy for the fourth field problem. Stability and efficiency of the implicit coupling algorithm are improved drawing on several methods to stabilize and to accelerate the convergence. To conclude and to review the effectiveness and the advantages of the additional thermal radiation field several numerical examples are considered to study the proposed algorithm. In particular we focus on an industrial application, namely the electro\textendash thermo-mechanical modeling of the field-assisted sintering technology.},

Large-scale calculation of the coupled fault zone process is often inhibited by the high-order interpolation of the displacement field required to overcome unstable tendencies of the finite elements in the incompressible and nearly incompressible limit. In this work we utilize a stabilized formulation in which the balance of mass is augmented with an additional term representing a stabilization to the incremental change in the pressure field. The stabilized formulation permits equal-order interpolation for the displacement and pore pressure fields and suppresses pore pressure oscillations in the incompressible and nearly incompressible limit. The technique is implemented with a recently developed critical state plasticity model to investigate transient fluid-flow/solid-deformation processes arising from slip weakening of a fault segment. The accompanying transient pore pressure development and dissipation can be used to predict fault rupture and directivity where fluid flow is an important driving force.},

The experimental results showed that the compression strength, stiffness, and specific energy absorption increased with the decrease in temperature and with the increase in strain rate. It also showed that, the compressive damage morphologies were sensitive to the change in temperature and strain rate. A coupled thermal-mechanical numerical analysis was conducted to find the thermo/mechanical coupling effect on the compressive crashworthiness of the three-dimensional composite tube. The temperature distributions in the braided preform and the resin during the impact compression were also calculated through finite element analysis. From the finite element analysis results, the inelastic heat generation was seen to be more in the preform than the matrix and its distribution and accumulation led to the damage progress along the loading direction.},

The variational formulation allows for general dissipative solids, including finite elastic and plastic deformations, non-Newtonian viscosity, rate sensitivity, arbitrary flow and hardening rules, as well as heat conduction. We show that a joint potential function exists such that both the conservation of energy and the balance of linear momentum equations follow as Euler\textendash Lagrange equations. The identification of the joint potential requires a careful distinction between equilibrium and external temperatures, which are equal at equilibrium.

Combining this heat conduction model and the finite-discrete element method (FDEM), we construct a coupled thermomechanical model for solving thermal cracking problems in brittle materials. The mechanical fracture calculation utilizes virtual joint elements between adjacent solid elements for fracture simulation. On the other hand, virtual joint elements are not included in the heat conduction model to improve numerical efficiency. When new cracks are generated, the node sharing relationship is dynamically updated in the heat conduction calculation to consider the thermal resistance effect of cracks. In this study, the proposed models are verified by simulating heat transfer, coupled thermomechanical, and thermal cracking problems in brittle materials. The numerical simulations are consistent with analytical solutions, and a complex thermal crack process can be realistically captured. These numerical examples verify the correctness of the proposed models, which can be powerful tools for solving heat transfer, coupled thermomechanical, and thermal cracking problems in brittle materials.},

The response of a liner viscoelastic material to a complex stess history can be calculated from the step-function response, but this is not so for plastics which are non-liner viscoelastic. The paper considers this from a mainly experimental viewpoint and underlines the general inadequacy of the current continuum echanical approach. The sections on recovery and intermittent stressing are of particular practical importance since it is under these conditions that plastic display particulary useful characteristics.},

A general anisotropic form and a specific isotropic formulation are proposed. A yield condition is not part of the theory and the transition from linear (elastic) to nonlinear (inelastic) behavior is continuous. Only total strains are used and the constant volume hypothesis is not employed. In this paper Poisson's ratio is assumed to be constant. The proposed equation can represent: initial linear elastic behavior; initial elastic response in torsion (tension) after arbitrary prestrain (prestress) in tension (torsion); linear elastic behavior for pure hydrostatic loading; initial elastic slope upon large instantaneous changes in strain rate; stress (strain)-rate sensitivity; creep and relaxation; defined behavior in the limit of very slow and very fast loading. Stress-strain curves obtained at different loading rates will ultimately have the same ``slope'' and their spacing is nonlinearly related to the loading rate.},

Krempl, 1979a, b), nonlinear in the Cauchy stress and the engineering strain but linear in the stress and strain-rates, is specialized to an overstress model. It is shown by qualitative arguments that the solutions correspond to typical room-temperature viscoplastic behavior of AISI type 304 stainless steel. Two unknown coefficient functions are determined by extrapolation of room temperature relaxation data for this steel. The stiff first-order nonlinear differential equations are then numerically integrated for a variety of test histories. These include strain control with strain-rates from 10-6 to 800s-1, stress control with stressrates from 1.95 kPa s-1 to 19.5 MPa s-1, instantaneous large changes in strain-rate and stress-rate, and partial unloading and reloading in strain and stress control and tension-tension cyclic creep. The computed results show good qualitative agreement with tests. Based on these results we consider that the model is a good representation of metal deformation behavior as long as the overstress does not change sign.},

The indeterminate stress component is a Lagrange multiplier enforcing the kinematic constraint, and it must be determined from equilibrium considerations. A simple polycrystalline model is constructed which precisely satisfies local kinematic constraints as well as global compatibility. Volume-average global stresses are obtained by approximating the local constraint stress as the corresponding projection of the (to-be-determined) global stress. Applications of the model to hexagonal crystals without pyramidal slip, and to large deformation and texturing of orthorhombic polycrystalline materials (olivine; HDPE) are made.},

The underlying principle is that the history of deformation is defined in terms of a time scale which is not measured by a clock, but is in itself a property of the material at hand. The theory is unifying in the sense that theories of plasticity, viscoelasticity and elasticity can be obtained from it as special cases by imposing suitable constraints on the material parameters involved furthermore, it does not make use of the idea of a yield surface.},

“In this work, the large deformation behaviour under monotonic loading and unloading of a high density polyethylene (HDPE) is studied.” (Ayoub et al., 2010, p. 329)“To analyze the nonlinear time-dependent response of the material, mechanical tests were conducted at room temperature under constant true strain rates and stress relaxation conditions.” (Ayoub et al., 2010, p. 329)“A physically-based inelastic model written under finite strain formulation is proposed to describe the mechanical behaviour of HDPE. In the model, the inelastic mechanisms involve two parallel elements: a visco-hyperelastic network resistance acting in parallel with a viscoelastic–viscoplastic intermolecular resistance where the amorphous and crystalline phases are explicitly taken into consideration. The semicrystalline polymer is considered as a two-phase composite.” (Ayoub et al., 2010, p. 329)“The influence of the crystallinity on the loading and unloading behaviour is investigated.” (Ayoub et al., 2010, p. 329)“To demonstrate the improved modelling capabilities, simulations are also performed using the original model of Boyce et al. [Boyce, M.C., Socrate, S., Llana, P.G., 2000. Constitutive model for the finite deformation stress–strain behavior of poly(ethylene terephthalate) above the glass transition. Polymer 41, 2183–2201] modified by Ahzi et al. [Ahzi, S., Makradi, A., Gregory, R.V., Edie, D.D., 2003. Modeling of deformation behavior and strain-induced crystallization in poly(ethylene terephthalate) above the glass transition temperature. Mechanics of Materials 35, 1139–1148].” (Ayoub et al., 2010, p. 329)“Polymers are used in a large range of applications, including aerospace and automotive industries, fluid transport and electronics.” (Ayoub et al., 2010, p. 329)“Polymers present a very complex nonlinear behaviour depending on external factors (such as triaxiality, strain rate and temperature) and structural parameters (such as crystallinity degree, molecular weights and crosslinking).” (Ayoub et al., 2010, p. 329)“Two approaches are usually used to develop constitutive models for polymers: either physically-based or phenomenologically-based.” (Ayoub et al., 2010, p. 329)“The physical approach is usually used to describe the behaviour of amorphous polymers while the phenomenological approach is usually applied to study semicrystalline polymers.” (Ayoub et al., 2010, p. 330)“Using this concept, Nikolov and Doghri (2000) and Nikolov et al. (2002) presented a micromechanical modelling to predict the small deformation behaviour of HDPE. van Dommelen et al. (2003) proposed a micromechanical modelling to simulate the elastic–viscoplastic behaviour and texture evolution of semicrystalline polymers at moderate strain level. The modelling introduced a rate and temperature dependence on the strain hardening resulting from molecular orientation. The model has the ability to describe qualitatively the stress–strain behaviour of HDPE. However, the results were presented without experimental comparisons.” (Ayoub et al., 2010, p. 330)“Although these models can reproduce in an acceptable way the large deformation elastic–viscoplastic response of polymers, they do not take into account the nonlinear response of these materials under unloading. To fill in this gap a number of constitutive equations were developed, the most of them through the infinitesimal deformation framework” (Ayoub et al., 2010, p. 330)“More recently, Dusunceli and Colak (2008) extended the Krempl model by incorporating the effect of crystallinity degree.” (Ayoub et al., 2010, p. 330)“The physically-based elastic–viscoplastic model proposed by Boyce et al. (2000) and Ahzi et al. (2003) was adopted and extended to develop a plausible constitutive model for describing the mechanical behaviour of semicrystalline polymers. In particular, the original model was modified to directly incorporate the nonlinear viscosity effects in the elastic part.” (Ayoub et al., 2010, p. 330)},

“The mechanical stress–strain behaviour of polyethylene (PE) materials under finite strains is studied both experimentally and theoretically.” (Ayoub et al., 2011, p. 492)“In order to gain insight into the structure and physical properties of investigated PE materials, a series of thermal (DSC and DMTA) and microstructural (small-angle X-ray scattering and AFM) characterizations have been undertaken.” (Ayoub et al., 2011, p. 492)“The influence of crystallinity on the various features of the tensile stressstrain response is considered over a large strain range, implying thermoplastic-like to elastomer-like mechanical behaviour.” (Ayoub et al., 2011, p. 492)“A physically-based hyperelastic–viscoplastic approach was adopted to develop a pertinent model for describing the mechanical behaviour of PE materials under finite strains. The semicrystalline polymer is being treated as a heterogeneous medium, and the model is based on a two-phase representation of the microstructure. The effective contribution of the crystalline and amorphous phases to the overall intermolecular resistance to deformation is treated in a composite framework, and coupled to a molecular network resistance to stretching and chain orientation capturing the overall strain hardening response.” (Ayoub et al., 2011, p. 492)“Comparisons between the constitutive model and experiments show fair agreement over a wide range of crystallinities (from 15\% to 72\%) and strain rates.” (Ayoub et al., 2011, p. 492)“The constitutive model is found to successfully capture the important features of the observed monotonic stress–strain response: the thermoplastic-like behaviour for high crystallinity includes a stiff initial response, a yield-like event followed by a gradual increase of strain hardening at very large strains; for the elastomer-like behaviour observed in the low crystallinity material, the strain hardening response is largely predominant. Strain recovery upon unloading increases with decreasing crystallinity: this is quantitatively well reproduced for high crystallinity materials, whereas predictions significantly deviate from experiments at low crystallinity.” (Ayoub et al., 2011, p. 492)“The use of semicrystalline polymers is steadily increasing owing to their potential to fulfill requirements for a large number of structural applications ranging from automotive/aeronautic to medical sectors.” (Ayoub et al., 2011, p. 493)“Their mechanical behaviour is highly nonlinear and sensitive to several external parameters (such as temperature, strain rate and triaxiality) and structural factors (including crystallinity index, crystal size and distribution in the structure, molecular weight, physical entanglement and cross-linking).” (Ayoub et al., 2011, p. 493)“Disregarding processing-induced effects, stiffness and yield resistance are mainly governed by the crystallinity index spanning from about 70\% down to a few percent only” (Ayoub et al., 2011, p. 493)“Starting from the work of Boyce et al. (2000), in which the elementary deformation mechanisms are described by two parallel resistances, Ahzi et al. (2003) (see also Makradi et al., 2005) and latter Ayoub et al. (2010) proposed rheological models for semicrystalline polymers. One resistance accounts for intermolecular interactions and the other deals with molecular network stretching and orientation process. The intermolecular resistance arises from a combination of amorphous and crystalline stiffness and flow. In such an approach, the crystal content is explicitly introduced in the model formulation.” (Ayoub et al., 2011, p. 493)“In the model proposed by Ahzi et al. (2003), the intermolecular amorphous and crystalline resistances are described according to the Arrhenius type expression proposed by Argon (1973) and later modified by Boyce et al. (2000).” (Ayoub et al., 2011, p. 493)“In order to improve the modelling capabilities during unloading process at small or moderate strains, Ayoub et al. (2010) proposed to directly incorporate the nonlinear viscosity effects on the elastic part by adopting the approach used by Colak (2005) in the overstress concept. In both cases, the network stress is described according to a visco-hyperelastic version of the eight-chain model of Arruda and Boyce (1993).” (Ayoub et al., 2011, p. 493)“The physically-based constitutive model proposed by Ahzi et al. (2003) was slightly modified in order to correctly describe the mechanical behaviour of PE materials.” (Ayoub et al., 2011, p. 493)},

	volume = {7},
	abstract = {The aim of this study is to understand the mechanism governing the transition strain rate of the elastic modulus in semi-crystalline polymer by coarse molecular dynamics (MD). In addition, the effects of the material properties such as molecular weight, crystallinity and lamella thickness on the elastic modulus are studied at various strain rates. The tensile deformation in the crystal direction at the various strain rates is simulated in the lamella MD model. As the results, the strong strain-rate dependency of the elastic modulus becomes prominent when the strain rate is larger than the structural relaxation rate. In addition, the crystallinity is the largest influencing factor on the elastic modulus, compared to the molecular weight and the lamella thickness. The transition strain rate of the elastic modulus gets smaller as the crystallinity increases. This means that the strong strain-rate dependency appears when the strain rate is larger than the relaxation rate of the amorphous phase. This is because the local strain rate of the amorphous phase is larger than that of the macroscopic strain rate.},

	abstract = {Nonlinear Solid Mechanics a Continuum Approach for Engineering Gerhard A. Holzapfel Graz University of Technology, Austria With a modern, comprehensive approach directed towards computational mechanics, this book covers a unique combination of subjects at present unavailable in any other text. It includes vital information on 'variational principles' constituting the cornerstone of the finite element method. In fact this is the only method by which Nonlinear Solid Mechanics is utilized in engineering practice. The book opens with a fundamental chapter on vectors and tensors. The following chapters are based on nonlinear continuum mechanics - an inevitable prerequisite for computational mechanicians. In addition, continuum field theory (applied to a representative sample of hyperelastic materials currently used in nonlinear computations such as incompressible and compressible materials) is presented, as are transversely isotropic materials, composite materials, viscoelastic materials and hyperelastic materials with isotropic damage. Another central chapter is devoted to the thermodynamics of materials, covering both finite thermoelasticity and finite thermoviscoelasticity. Also included are:* an up-to-date list of almost 300 references and a comprehensive index* useful examples and exercises for the student* selected topics of statistical and continuum thermodynamics.Furthermore, the principle of virtual work (in both the material and spatial descriptions) is compared with two and three-field variational principles particularly designed to capture kinematic constraints such as incompressibility. All of the features combined result in an essential text for final year undergraduates, postgraduates and researchers in mechanical, civil and aerospace engineering and applied maths and physics.},

To characterise continuous media in the context of thermodynamics, in general, one needs two material functions, in particular, a thermodynamic potential that defines all thermodynamic properties of the system and a constitutive law for the heat flux vector. (Note that the material constitutive behavior describes how the material reacts to deformation, wheres the constitutive equation for the heat flux describes how heat transfer is performed within the body).
The thermodynamic potential is a function from which we may derive state variables characterising the thermodynamic state of a system.
One of the most common and useful thermodynamic potentials is the so-called Helmohltz free energy. The application of this approach to the Clausis-Planck inequality allows obtaining direct expressions for the stress and entropy. For isothermal processes, the free-energy can also be associated with the internal strain energy functions, and as the status of the potential for stress.
It should be remembered that one needs to proceed with some thermodynamic potential to fully characterise the system. For instance, by choosing the Helmohltz free-energy, one can obtain the First Piola-Kirchhoff by derivative relative to the deformation gradient and the entropy by differentiation relative to the temperature. In contrast, if the internal energy is chosen instead, the First Piola-Kirchhoff is obtained by deriving relative to teh deformation gradient at constant entropy, while the temperature is obtained by deriving relative to the entropy at constant deformation.
The specific heat at constant deformation can be obtained by deriving the internal energy relative to temperature at fixed deformation, or equal to the symmetric of the second order derivative of the Helmohltz free-energy multiplier by the absolute temperature.
Depending on the dependent variables used to describe the constitutive behavior of the material, namely, a measure of deformation (F or C) alongside a non-mechanical variable (T or s), it is possible to define the isothermal and isentropic material tangent modulus. These are relevant for the definition of the problem splitting strategy employed in partitioned/staggered numerical solution approaches. While the isothermal approach is conditionally stable, the isentropic split has been shown to retain uncondition stability,

	abstract = {This paper presents a comparison of various models for strain‐softening due to damage such as cracking or void growth, as proposed recently in the literature. Continuum‐based models expressed in terms of softening stress—strain relations, and fracture‐type models expressed in terms of softening stress—displacement relations are distinguished. From one‐dimensional wave propagation calculations, it is shown that strain‐localization into regions of finite size cannot be achieved. The previously well‐documented spurious convergence is obtained with continuum models, while stress—displacement relations cannot model well smeared‐crack situations. Continuum models may, however, be used in general if a localization limiter is implemented. Gradient‐type localization limiters appear to be rather complicated; they require solving higher‐order differential equations of equilibrium with additional bourdary conditions. Non‐local localization limiters, especially the non‐local continuum with local strain, in which only the energy dissipating variables are non‐local, is found to be very effective, and also seems to be physically realistic. This formulation can correctly model the transition between homogeneous damage states and situations in which damage localizes into small regions that can be viewed as cracks. The size effect observed in the experimental and numerical response of specimens in tension or compression is shown to be a consequence of this progressive transition from continuum‐type to fracture‐type formulations.},

            The strong influence of relatively small amounts of filler particles, such as carbon black, on the mechanical properties of elastomers has been well known for decades and has significantly contributed to increased use of elastomeric materials in many commercial applications. Even though the use of fillers is ubiquitous, satisfactory understanding and modeling of the micromechanisms by which fillers alter the mechanical behavior of elastomers has still not been realized. In this work the influence of filler particles on the equilibrium stress-strain response has been investigated. First, an experimental investigation probing the behavior of a chloroprene rubber with varied filler content has been performed. The experimental data allowed for a direct evaluation of both a newly developed constitutive model based on the amplification of the first strain invariant, and a number of other models proposed in the literature. A direct comparison with experimental data suggest that the new model generates superior predictions, particularly for large strain deformations. Then, in an effort to examine some of the assumptions that are common in the constitutive modeling and also to try to determine which of the input parameters are most important, a detailed series of micromechanical models were constructed using two- and three-dimensional finite element simulations. The results indicate that the effect of filler particles on the equilibrium behavior of elastomers can be accurately predicted using stochastic three-dimensional simulations suggesting that successful modeling mainly requires a rigorous treatment of the composite nature of the microstructure and not molecular level concepts such as alteration of mobility or effective crosslinking density in the elastomeric phase of the material.},

The mechanical behaviour of these polymers is difficult to grasp, highly dependent on time and temperature, and particularly sensitive to chemical ageing, an important point when evaluating the time life of structures. The development of constitutive equations which can describe the evolution of the mechanical memory of semicrystalline polymers and their insertion in a computer code employing the finite element method are preferential means for improving structural design.},

	abstract = {The Hamiltonian Bracket Formulation combined with the Avrami equation was used to develop a model for the flow-induced crystallization of polymers. The amorphous part of the chain was modeled as a non-linear Hookean dumbbell and the crystalline part as a rigid rod. Evolution equations for the configuration tensors of the two phases and for the degree of crystallinity were obtained and were subsequently solved for the transient and cessation case under different flow conditions. The model has a number of parameters that can be obtained (with the exception of one) from Theological measurements and quiescent crystallization experiments. The model predicts the variation in the degree of crystallinity and the induction time as a function of the polymer properties and the processing conditions. The model can also be used to predict the development of birefringence. The predictions of the model are in general agreement with the experimental observations.},

The need for rigorous consideration of both theoretical and algorithmic issues is emphasized, particularly in relation to the computational treatment of ﬁnite-strain elasto-plastic (viscoplastic) deformation, the modelling of frictional contact conditions and element technology capable of dealing with material incompressibility. Practically important aspects such as adaptive mesh reﬁnement procedures are discussed and attention is given to choice of appropriate error estimators for elasto-plastic materials and the transfer of solution parameters between successive meshes. The role of explicit solution techniques in the simulation of large-scale nonlinear problems is also discussed. The concept of discrete elements is brieﬂy described and their applications to a wide range of solid mechanics problems illustrated. Some advances in the ﬁeld of iterative equation solution methods are reviewed and their potential advantages in the simulation of large-scale nonlinear solid mechanics problems are demonstrated.},

	abstract = {Abstract The temperature, strain-rate, and pressure dependences of the yield stress have been determined for two polyethylene homopolymers of differing molecular weights and for a polyethylene copolymer. Samples were prepared by slowly cooling from the melt, and also by quenching in order to assess the effects of morphology on the yield behavior. The data have been analyzed on the basis of two Eyring processes acting in parallel. Comparison of all data sets reveals the existence in general of three distinct activated processes each with its own temperature, strain-rate, and pressure dependences. The relative contribution of each process is dependent on the molecular weight, morphology, etc. Also discussed is the relation of these three yield processes to the well-known loss processes of linear viscoelasticity.},

Therefore many attempts were carried out to find quantitative, or at least qualitative, models of non-linear behavior. The general or perhaps most attractive way of developing rheological constitutive equations consists in the search for the most general method to describe everything in the framework of a single approach. Naturally, this leads to very complicated and ambiguous equations. Meanwhile, it is reasonable to try another way based on separating observed phenomena into different types depending on observed phenomena into different types depending on their physical origin. An attempt to propose such their physical origin. An attempt to propose such classification of nonlinear rheological effects is made.},

	abstract = {The basic physical concepts of classical continuum mechanics are body, configuration of a body, and force system acting on a body. In a formal rational development of the subject, one first tries to state precisely what mathematical entities represent these physical concepts: a body is regarded to be a smooth manifold whose elements are the material points; a configuration is defined as a mapping of the body into a three-dimensional Euclidean space, and a force system is defined to be a vector-valued function defined for pairs of bodies1. Once these concepts are made precise one can proceed to the statement of general principles, such as the principle of objectivity or the law of balance of linear momentum, and to the statement of specific constitutive assumptions, such as the assertion that a force system can be resolved into body forces with a mass density and contact forces with a surface density, or the assertion that the contact forces at a material point depend on certain local properties of the configuration at the point. While the general principles are the same for all work in classical continuum mechanics, the constitutive assumptions vary with the application in mind and serve to define the material under consideration.},

	abstract = {A comprehensive constitutive theory for the thermo-mechanical behaviour of generalized continua is established within the framework of continuum thermodynamics of irreversible processes. It represents an extension of the class of generalized standard materials to higher order and higher grade continuum theories. It reconciles most existing frameworks and proposes some new extensions for micromorphic and strain gradient media. The special case of strain gradient plasticity is also included as a contribution to the current debate on the consideration of energetic and dissipative mechanisms. Finally, the stress gradient continuum theory emerges as a new research field for which an elastic-viscoplastic theory at finite deformations is provided for the first time.

Here we provide an overview of the subject for both elastic and viscoelastic materials in order to understand the behavior of these materials. We begin with a brief introduction of some basic terminology and relationships in continuum mechanics, and a review of equations of motion in a continuum in both Lagrangian and Eulerian forms. To complete the set of equations, we then proceed to present and discuss a number of speciﬁc forms for the constitutive relationships between stress and strain proposed in the literature for both elastic and viscoelastic materials. In addition, we discuss some applications for these constitutive equations. Finally, we give a computational example describing the motion of soil experiencing dynamic loading by incorporating a speciﬁc form of constitutive equation into the equation of motion.},

Examples related to isothermal solid mechanics in the frame of small perturbation theory, including viscoplasticity and damge of ductile materials, are given.

	abstract = {Transient tests are used to demonstrate unusual or even paradoxical deformation behaviors in metallic alloys and polymers at ambient and elevated temperatures. Included are repeated relaxation tests and creep tests of short duration. It is shown that creep rate need not increase with a stress increase and that, at the same stress level, creep rate can be different on loading and unloading. Also, a stress magnitude increase can be found during relaxation. Once steady inelastic flow is reached, the relaxation rate is nearly independent of the stress and strain at which relaxation starts; it depends mainly on the preceding prior inelastic strain rate. These phenomena can be modeled using an overstress (effective stress) dependence of inelastic rate of deformation and a proper evolution law for a single state variable, the equilibrium stress (back stress) within the context of a “unified” state variable theory. The author and his students have developed the viscoplasticity theory based on overstress (VBO) that can model these unusual behaviors.},

This article is an attempt to answer the question, what material characteristics determine which of the various kinds of nonuniform or unstable deformation are observed, and how rapidly do they develop. It is an exposition of a scheme to evaluate and represent relevant material properties, and it lays the groundwork for a prediction of macroscopic behavior under various boundary conditions. The review presented is a personal one, which has not as yet had the benefit of sufficient wide-spread scrutiny. While many of its component parts are rephrased versions of results absorbed from the literature, there are some novel suggestions.},

Cette étude fournit une description de la déformation structurale d'éprouvettes de PA11 moulées par compression lors d'une déformation uniaxiale avant striction et en dessous de la température de transition vitreuse. La littérature, peu nombreuse, dénote une grande disparité dans la description du polymorphisme du PA11. La morphologie semicristalline de ce polymère solide issu de l'état fondu est de type sphérolitique. Les techniques utilisées ici pour caractériser la microstructure des échantillons sont la diffusion centrale des rayons X (DCRX) et la diffusion des rayons X aux grands angles (DRX) permettant de décrire la microstructure, respectivement, à l'échelle des lamelles et à l'échelle des différentes structures macromoléculaires. Une étude DRX des éprouvettes soumises a différents traitements thermiques a mis en évidence la présence de trois types de structures macromoléculaires : cristalline (phase [alpha], 20\% en volume en première approximation), amorphe (60\%) et smectique (phase [delta]', 20\%). Les éprouvettes sont maintenues en déformation pendant les mesures de diffusion des rayons X. L'étude des paramètres descriptifs des pics de diffusion a montré que les lamelles s'orientent faiblement dans la direction de traction, de même que les segments de chaine des phases amorphe et smectique, ce qui permet de supposer que la phase smectique est incluse dans la phase amorphe. A contrario, les segments de chaine de la phase cristalline, constituant les lamelles, s'orientent de façon très marquée perpendiculairement à la direction de traction. La comparaison des résultats issus des deux échelles différentes a permis de proposer l'activation d'un mécanisme de maclage au sein des lamelles orientées parallèlement à la direction de traction},

The polymer deformation is described by an improved macromolecular constitutive model accounting for strain-rate-, pressure-, and temperature-sensitive yielding, isotropic hardening before peak yield, intrinsic postyield softening, and rapid anisotropic hardening at large strains. A new craze model that accounts for craze initiation, growth, and breakdown mechanisms is employed. An energy-based criterion is used for cavitation induced cracking that can lead to fiber/matrix debonding. The role of voids is clarified by conducting a comparative study of unit cells with and without voids. The effects of strain rate and temperature are investigated by a parametric study. The overall composite stress-strain response is also depicted to indicate manifestation of microlevel failure on macroscopic behavior.},

  abstract = {A large deformation viscoplastic polycrystal theory is formulated. It is restricted to loading conditions since elasticity is entirely neglected. The single crystal behavior is based on crystallographic slip, and the slip rate is a non-linear function of the resolved shear stress. The time independent plasticity is obtained as a limit when the rate sensitivity tends to zero. The polycrystal behavior is obtained from the single crystal constitutive relation by solving integral equations derived from the field equations. A self-consistent approach is developed, where each grain is assumed to be a single ellipsoidal inclusion in a homogeneous equivalent medium. An interaction formula is derived and the local strain rates are calculated by resolving a nonlinear system of equations. Applications to texture predictions in tension, compression, rolling and torsion are finally considered. R\'esum\'e Nous formulons une th\'eorie des polycristaux viscoplastiques \`a forte d\'eformation, limit\'ee aux conditions de charge car on n\'eglige enti\`erement le domaine k\'elastique. Le comportement du monocristal est bas\'e sur le glissement cristallographique, et la vitesse de glissement est une fonction non lin\'eaire de la contrainte de cisaillement r\'eduite. La limite obtenue lorsque la sensibilit\'e \`a la vitesse tend vers z\'ero, constitue la plasticit\'e ind\'ependante du temps. On obtient le comportement du polycristal \`a partir de la relation de base du monocristal en r\'esolvant les \'equations int\'egrales d\'eriv\'ees des \'equations de champ. Nous d\'eveloppons une approche autocoh\'erente o\`u l'on assimile chaque grain \`a une inclusion ellipso\"idale unique dans un milieu homog\`ene \'equivalent. Nous en d\'eduisons une formule d'interaction et nous calculons les vitesses de d\'eformation locales en r\'esolvant un syst\`eme non lin\'eaire d'\'equations. Nous consid\'erons enfin les applications de cette approche \`a la pr\'evision des textures en tension, en compression, en laminage et en torsion. Zusammenfassung Es wird eine Theorie f\"ur das viskoplastische Verhalten von Polykristallen bei gro{$\beta$}en Verformungen vorgelegt. Diese Theorie ist auf Lastbedingungen beschr\"ankt, da die Elastizit\"at vollst\"angig vernachl\"assigt wird. Das Einkristallverhalten basiert auf kristallografischer Gleitung, die Gleitgeschwin-digkeitist eine nichtlineare Funktion der Flie{$\beta$}spannung. Das von der Zeit unabh\"angige plastische Verhalten ergibt sich, wenn die Geschwindigkeitsempfindlichkeit zu Null wird. Das Verhalten des Polykristalles ergibt sich aus den Einkristallbeziehungen, indem die aus den Feldgleichungen abgeleiteten Integralgleichungen gel\"ost werden. Eine selbst-konsistente N\"aherung wird entwickelt, bei dem jedes einzelne Korn als ein ellipsoidf\"ormiger Einschlu{$\beta$} in einem homogenen \"aquivalentmedium angesehen wird. Eine Wechselwirkungsformel wird hergeleitet und die lokalen Verformungsraten werden durch L\"osung eines nichtlinearen Gleichungssystems berechnet.

  abstract = {The finite deformation response of an epoxy resin is investigated in the glassy regime using a constitutive relation that accounts for thermally activated yielding, pressure-sensitivity, strain softening and molecular chain reorientation. A previous formulation of this macromolecular model is modified so as to decouple the onset of yielding from the peak nominal stress, and enable accurate modeling of temperature and strain-rate effects concurrently. The latter cannot be modeled adequately with existing models when the temperature dependence of elastic moduli is accounted for. Tension and compression experiments are carried out on Epon 862 across a range of temperatures and strain rates. Special care is taken to extract the intrinsic material behavior from the recorded mechanical responses using a new technique of video-based extensometry, which is well adapted to cylindrical geometries. Key features of the data include a temperature dependence of elastic moduli and a tension\textendash compression asymmetry that goes beyond differences in peak yield. The experimental data is divided in two sets for model calibration and assessment. The first set contains sufficient data to identify all model parameters following a procedure outlined in the paper. The second data set is used to assess the predictive capabilities of the model for test conditions not used in the calibration step. It is shown that when the tension and compression cases are treated separately, with respect to post-peak softening, model predictions are excellent over the investigated ranges of temperature and strain rate.},

An essential feature of the formulation is that the total deformation rate is considered to be separable into elastic and inelastic components which are functions of state variables at all stages of loading and unloading. The theory, therefore, is independent of a yield criterion or loading and unloading conditions. The deformation rate components are determinable from the current state which permits an incremental formulation of problems. Strain hardening is considered in the equations by introducing plastic work as the representative state variable. The problem of tensile straining has been examined for a number of histories that included straining at various rates, rapid changes of strain rate, unloading and reloading, and stress relaxation. The calculations were based on material constants chosen to represent commercially pure titanium. The results are in good agreement with corresponding experiments on titanium specimens.},

	abstract = {Morphological studies of plastic deformation of single crystals, thin layers, and bulk samples together with mechanical, X-ray and infra-red data revealed the existence of three stages in cold drawing of crystalline polymer: the plastic deformation of the original spherulitic structure, the discontinuous transformation of the spherulitic into fibre structure by micronecking, and the plastic deformation of the fibre structure. The initial material, which has low strength and high ductility, consist of stacks of parallel lamellae with few interlamella links. It deforms plastically by stack rotation, sliding of lamellae, phase change and twinning of crystal lattice, chain slip and tilt until the predeformed lamellae reach the position of maximum compliance for fracture by micronecking. The micronecks transform every single lamella into microfibrils of between one and three hundred angstroms in width, consisting of folded chain blocks broken off the lamella primarily by chain slip in the boundary layers between adjacent mosaic blocks. The chains bridging the crack are partially unfolded during the micronecking process. They connect in axial direction the blocks in the microfibril as intrafibrillar tie molecules. The number of microfibrils per cm of crack length increases with molecular weight. The draw ratio of the microfibrils and the axial separation in the microfibril of the originally adjacent crystal blocks increase with the average distance between microfibrils and, hence, decrease with increasing molecular weight. The concentration of micronecks in every stack of lamellae in a thin destruction zone produces a bundle of microfibrils of rather uniform draw ratio. Such a fibril measuring a few thousand angstroms in width includes the interlamella ties of the original sample as interfibrillar tie molecules connecting adjacent microfibrils. The concentration of micronecks also provides the conditions for a nearly adiabatic heating of the generated fibril by the transformation work in the destruction zone. The local temperature rise imparts so much mobility to the chains in the crystal blocks that during subsequent cooling to ambient temperature, the long period becomes adjusted to this temperature. The more or less random distribution of destruction zones in the neck makes the transformation from spherulitic to fibre structure appear to be a gradual process in spite of the discontinuous transformation in the micronecks. The plastic deformation of the new fibre structure can proceed only by longitudinal sliding of microfibrils past each other, a process limited by interfibrillar tie molecules. Hence, high molecular weight samples with many interlamella links exhibit a smaller draw ratio than lower molecular weight material. The three stages are to some extent intermixed in the neck. In the initial neck characterised by a low draw ratio and rather gentle constriction, the transformation into the fibre structure is not complete, so that some of the remains of the original microspherulitic structure are still present in the necked portion. They are destroyed during subsequent drawing which completes the transformation and also deforms the fibre structure. The sharply constricted mature neck, however, yields a high draw ratio which is composed of the draw ratio of microfibrils and of subsequent sliding motion of the microfibrils. The technically important natural draw ratio is the maximum draw ratio obtained with the sample under the conditions of the experiment. It seems to be higher than the draw ratio of the microfibrils.},

            Transient creep of many materials at high temperatures obeys Andrade's law, in which creep strain is proportional to the cube root of time. The present paper aims at revisiting in terms of criticality the different explanations proposed so far. In agreement with Mott's statistical theory, and using the concept of load shedding and mechanical cascades introduced in Cottrell's microscopic model, we show that Andrade creep is obtained assuming only long range back stresses and delayed obstacle overcoming, both of them involving a large number of interacting sites responsible for stress fluctuations. The time exponent is 1/3 if work hardening is linear, and larger otherwise. Andrade's creep appears as a power law approach of the linear (or χ) creep regime.},

Haasen plot revealed that the mobile dislocation density remained almost invariant at the juncture where there was a sudden increase in stress with the change in strain rate and the plastic flow was solely dependent on the velocity of mobile dislocations. In that critical regime, the variation of stress with time was fitted with a Boltzman type Sigmoid function. The increase in stress was found to increase with final strain rate and the time elapsed to attain these stress values showed a decreasing trend. Both of these parameters saturated asymptotically at higher final strain rate.},

They are commonly described either by a change in the isotropic strength of a material due to an increase in dislocation density or by a change in directional hardening, often described by a backstress. Here we look at transients as developed by load redistribution in Finite Element simulations. Two types of material models are used. The first contains grains with binary strength; the other uses grains with a continuous distribution of strengths. It was found that the load redistribution process is an important source in transient yielding and creep. An equivalent stress quantity to track the strength of a sample during deformation is proposed. Using this quantity a single load shedding curve can be obtained for both the tensile and creep tests. This unifies the material constitutive behavior for the very different boundary conditions seen in creep and constant-rate testing.},

The SMARTS (Spectrometer for MAterials Research at Temperature and Stress) diffractometer has been used to measure the crystalline lattice displacements in polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) for crystalline phase IV (at room temperature) in tension and compression and for crystalline phase I (at 60°C) in compression. The chemical structure of PTFE, -(C2F4)-n, makes it ideally suited for investigation by neutron methods as it is free of hydrogen that results in limited penetration depths and poor diffraction acquisition in most polymers. Deformation parallel to the prismatic plane normals is shown to occur by inter-polymer chain compression with a modulus ∼10× bulk, while deformation parallel to the basal plane normal occurs by intra-polymer chain compression with a modulus ∼1000× bulk, corresponding with theoretical values for a PTFE chain modulus. Deformation parallel to the pyramidal plane normals is accommodated by inter-polymer chain shear.},

Anisotropic effects are characterized through tensile tests using several complex loading paths involving large deformation, and for different orientation with respect to the extrusion direction. A mechanical model is then developed, based on a non-equilibrium thermodynamic approach of irreversible processes, resulting in a new thermodynamic potential describing both the elasto-viscoelastic–viscoplastic behavior and the volume variation due to damage. Results show that transverse strains and volume strain of HDPE highly depend on specimen orientation, whereas the apparent Young's modulus is not affected by this orientation.

The geometry and dimensions of the specimens were determined after a critical evaluation of the test conditions, so as to avoid plastic buckling of the specimens, and to minimize undesirable stresses at the specimen ends. Using the present technique, it was possible to conduct tests at room temperature up to strains of 200\% for polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) and 1000\% for polyethylene, without extensive crazing. Optimum precision and homogeneity of strains within the samples could be achieved because of firm guiding of the gripped specimen heads during the tests. A systematic study of the influence of shear strain rate and temperature on the plastic behaviour was made particularly for the polyethylene samples. The kinematics of large deformation simple shear is discussed and relations between the stress and the finite-strain tensors is presented, with particular attention being paid to the development of normal stresses. The problem of end effects is also investigated. Finally, it is shown that the strain hardening of polyethylene under simple shear is much smaller than under uniaxial tension. A possible interpretation of this behaviour is proposed in terms of the uniqueness versus multiplicity of slip systems.},

The yield stress showed a region of low, relatively constant, rate dependence at low strain rates, high temperatures and low pressures and a second region of higher strain-rate dependence at high strain rates and pressures. In contrast, the fracture stress was found throughout to have a relatively constant strain-rate dependence of intermediate value between those obtained for the yield stress. These features confirmed that failure can be considered as competition between yield and fracture processes. The fracture stress became lower than the yield stress at both high and low strain rates where brittle fracture was observed, with fully ductile behaviour resulting in intermediate conditions where the fracture stress exceeded the yield stress. The pressure, strain rate and temperature dependence of the yield stress was well described by two Eyring processes acting in parallel, both processes being pressure dependent.},

  abstract = {The constitutive behaviour of amorphous polymers near the glass transition contains many features general to this class of materials. A new, physically based, three-dimensional constitutive model has been developed for simulating this wide range of features in models of polymer products and processes. In particular, the model displays glassy response at low temperatures and short time-scales, and rubber-like response at high temperatures and long time-scales, and is therefore an example of a glass-rubber constitutive model. Its basis is the assumed additivity of free energies of bond distortion and conformation perturbation. For the elastic bond distortion stress-strain law and flow model, and the conformational entropy function, the model employs linear elasticity, Eyring viscous flow and the Edwards-Vilgis entropy function, respectively. Glass structure and temperature dependence are introduced through the Vogel-Tammann-Fulcher and Arrhenius equations for viscosity, respectively. With parameters obtained for poly(ethylene terephthalate) in a companion paper, the model was solved numerically to simulate a variety of uniaxial strain sequences, and found to replicate well the characteristic patterns of behaviour of amorphous polymers in the temperature region of interest, over a wide range of experimental situations from small to large strains. The only major deficiency, resulting from the simplifying assumption of a single activation barrier height, is its being too localized in the time domain. At high temperatures and long times, applicability of the model is limited by the onset of conformational relaxation.},

Whereas the viscoelastic strain rates are assumed to be derivable from the appropriate creep integral laws of classical viscoelasticity, the plastic strain rates in stress space are dependent not only on the path history but also the time history of stress. After postulating the existence of a regular loading surface in the viscoelastic-plastic state and deducing the appropriate criterion for loading, a major portion of the paper is devoted to establishing (a) the convexity of the loading surface, (b) the direction of the plastic strain-rate vector in stress space, and (c) the structure of the constitutive equations for the plastic strain rates. The loading surface of the present theory (in contrast to that of the inviscid theory of plasticity), being dependent on certain measures representing time history of stress, is allowed to change its shape continually; this has implications in the interpretation of experimental results dealing with the determination of the initial and subsequent yield surfaces where corners are observed.},

	abstract = {Primary and steady-state creep deformation of 316LN stainless steel with four different nitrogen weight percent (0.07, 0.11, 0.14, and 0.22\% N) have been examined in the framework of internal stress based kinetic creep law. The interrelationship between activation area or activation volume and effective stress has been employed in the present model, rather than the applied stress dependency on these thermodynamic quantities. The model predicted the decrease in obstacle spacing and the increase in internal stress with nitrogen at all the applied stress levels. Across the nitrogen content, the evaluated activation volume ranging from 400 to 900 b3 suggested the dominance of forest dislocation intersections coupled with the non-conservative motion of jogged dislocations during steady-state creep. The rate constant parameter of the model associated with the dynamic recovery exhibited a decreasing trend with nitrogen. The variations in the strength enhanced activation volume and length of the dislocation segment against the applied stress/yield strength exhibited the unified power law relationships, irrespective of nitrogen content. The model appropriately predicted the creep strain/rate vs. time curves and steady-state creep rate vs. internal stress and effective stress quantities. By incorporating the damage term into the creep rate equation, the developed model is extended for the prediction of entire creep strain-time curves.
In the present study, sine hyperbolic creep rate law coupled with the evolution of internal stress with time has been employed for modelling transient and steady state creep deformation behaviours of type 316LN austenitic stainless steel (SS). The model predicts the creep strain-time and creep rate-time data appropriately for the stress levels ranging from 120 to 225 MPa at 923 K, with good agreement between experimental and predicted steady state creep rates. At all the stress levels, the predicted internal stress increases with time during transient creep, and it approaches saturation at steady state creep. The predicted increase in internal stress was interrelated to the increase in dislocation density and a decrease in the mean free path during creep deformation. At steady state condition, a decrease in activation volume with an increase in applied stress levels has been observed for the steel. The estimated value of activation volume for the steel demonstrates the dominance of intersection of forest dislocations and non-conservative motion of jogs during transient creep in type 316LN SS. The applicability of the present model has been demonstrated towards the prediction of stress-relaxation behaviour of type 316LN SS based on the power law interrelation between internal stress and applied stress.
Creep deformation of an advanced high-strength, creep-resistant austenitic stainless steel Sanicro 25 was investigated experimentally at temperatures from 700 °C to 800 °C and stresses below 40 MPa. Results show that the creep behaviour is qualitatively similar as that of the other creep-resistant steels, having much weaker stress and temperature dependencies of the creep rate than those at higher stresses. Creep performance of the Sanicro 25 steel allows temperatures of at least 50 °C higher than the classical AISI-316 H austenitic steel, even at low stresses.
Creep experiments are time consuming and expensive; moreover, it is not possible to carry out experiments under the actual service conditions of particular materials due to the very low creep strain rate. However, the process seems to be an ideal field for computer modelling. The experimental data are obviously only available for steady-state conditions, and so the effects of varying conditions during startup or shutdown of the components can be described by modelling. Modelling creep deformation is usually based on the so-called “creep constitutive equations”, which describe the strain rate dependence on stress, temperature and time, or creep strain. Unfortunately, the equations are derived from conventional creep experiments under constant load conditions, and so the transient effects upon stress changes are ignored. Because the stress is transformed between model elements, a correct description of the creep behaviour must contain the transient effects. In this work, the conventional approach to describing primary and secondary creep stages is combined with an internal stress model of the transient creep stage to address the problem of the stress changes, as well as that of the low-stress creep regime.
To investigate creep mechanisms of Inconel718 and Allvac718Plus, creep behaviors of two alloys are studied under the temperature of 700 °C and three applied stresses (560 MPa, 650 MPa and 720 MPa) by using multiple microstructural analysis methods, including scanning electron microscope (SEM), emission scanning electron microscope (FSEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Result shows that steady-state region is not observed in these two alloys. Creep curves of two alloys are composed of primary region and tertiary region. Tertiary region occupies a dominant position. Ductile dimples are observed on creep fracture surface, indicating creep mechanisms of two alloys are the formation of creep voids. In this study, the formation of creep voids is found to be correlated with three factors which are dislocation multiplication, dislocation motion and dislocation obstacles. Inconel718 has higher dislocation multiplication rate, larger dislocation motion rate, more δ phases and less bands than Allvac718Plus. Therefore, Inconel718 has higher creep voids rate than Allvac718Plus, leading to the result that Inconel718 has shorter creep life than Allvac718Plus.
A mathematical model to predict creep properties of Ni-based superalloys at intermediate temperature ranges based on microstructure, process and creep condition, and material properties has been developed by modifying and combining previous models. Modifications are made so that as many necessary model parameters as possible, whose values have been obtained from experimental measurement of creep properties, are determined from CALPHAD (CALculation of PHAse Diagrams) thermodynamic calculations. The model can reproduce minimum creep rate, creep rupture time, and time to specific strain for a wide range of Ni-based superalloys, correlating well with experimental data without any further creep experiments. The applicability and limitation of the model as an alloy design tool for new Ni-based superalloys with improved creep properties are discussed in this paper.
The effect of Ag nanoparticles (NPs) on the optical properties of ZnO has been investigated. Samples of pure and Ag doped ZnO were synthesized by the combustion method. X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscope and UV–vis spectrophotometer measurements confirmed the growth of Ag NPs in the ZnO matrix. The near band edge (NBE) emission from ZnO excited by a 325 nm He-Cd laser was significantly enhanced in the presence of {\textasciitilde}5 nm diameter Ag NPs. The experimental results suggest that the origin of enhanced NBE emission is due to direct interaction between the laser photons and Ag NPs, which in turn leads to photoemission transfer of electrons from the Ag NPs to the conduction band of ZnO. This is different from previously reported mechanisms where the photoemission transfer of electrons was mediated by plasmon decay.
The electronic structures, magnetic properties and half-metallicity in Zr2IrZ (Z = Al, Ga, In) alloys with the Hg2CuTi-type structure were systematically investigated by using the first-principle calculations. Zr2IrZ (Z = Al, Ga, In) alloys are predicted to be half-metallic ferrimagnets which are quite robust against hydrostatic strain and tetragonal deformation. The total magnetic moment of Zr2IrZ (Z = Al, Ga, In) alloys mainly originates from the 4d electrons of Zr atoms and follows the conventional Slater-Pauling rule: Mt = Zt−18. (Mt is the total magnetic moment per unit cell and Zt is the valence concentration). The origin of the band gap for Zr2IrZ (Z = Al, Ga, In) alloys is also well studied. Unconventionally, Zr2Ir-based alloys contain element with 5d valence electrons, which implies a wider field to search for new half-metallic materials.
Samples from normalized and tempered modified 9Cr–1Mo steel, were normalized at three different temperatures and rolled at four different temperatures and subsequently tempered. Samples were then subjected to instrumented Charpy impact tests. Impact properties were represented in terms of upper shelf energy, ductile-to-brittle transition temperature, 28 J energy transition temperature, general yield temperature, blunt-notched dynamic fracture toughness (Kjd) and reference temperature. Kjd was determined following the modified Schindler’s procedure. Correlation between different transition temperatures and their conservativeness were analyzed in view of fracture safe design. Finally, microstructural parameters were related to the impact transition temperatures based on microstructural and fractographic studies.

We found a rich set of the structural phase transitions and triple points on the T − p phase diagrams. Extensive and intensive BCE near some transformations and around triple points in both crystals are outstanding ({\textbar}∆ SBCEmax {\textbar} = 30–100 J/kg·K; {\textbar}∆ TADmax {\textbar} = 4–22 K) and can be achieved at low pressure 0.01–0.60 GPa.

A new kind of magneto-mechanical effect of Ni-Mn-Ga microwire is explored by combining stress field-induced twist (SFIT) with magnetic field-induced twist (MFIT) under the condition of stress-magnetic coupling. It has been found that Ni-Mn-Ga shape memory microwire exhibits a large recoverable strain up to 12\%, superelastic strain of {\textasciitilde} 9\% with critical stress for martensitic transformation {\textasciitilde} 66 MPa. On the basis of excellent mechanical properties, a reversible SFIT angle of 5.2° for the total length (18 cm) of the microwire and a recoverable MFIT angle up to 1250″/cm have been achieved. By controlling the stress to make the microwire in different stages during martensitic transformation, the total MFIT angle (excluding SFIT angle) decreases slightly at the stage of austenite elastic deformation, then increases again during martensitic variant reorientation. The MFIT angle changes periodically as a function of the magnetic field magnitude and direction. The relationships between the MFIT angle and the static force, magnetic field, magnetic field torsional angle are summarized in this paper. The coupling coefficient k corresponding to the austenite and martensite is obtained. This phenomenon provides a new way to achieve large twist under the condition of stress-magnetic coupling for smart materials.
In this work we investigate the Orowan hypothesis, that decreases in surface energy due to surface adsorbates lead directly to lowered fracture toughness, at an atomic/molecular level. We employ a Lennard-Jones system with a slit crack and an infiltrating fluid, nominally with gold-water properties, and explore steric effects by varying the soft radius of fluid particles and the influence of surface energy/hydrophobicity via the solid–fluid binding energy. Using previously developed methods, we employ the J{\textless}math{\textgreater}{\textless}mrow is="true"{\textgreater}{\textless}mi is="true" mathvariant="bold"{\textgreater}J{\textless}/mi{\textgreater}{\textless}/mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}/math{\textgreater}-integral to quantify the sensitivity of fracture toughness to the influence of the fluid on the crack tip, and exploit dimensionless scaling to discover universal trends in behavior.},

The problem is to understand the creation and movement of kinks as the elementary vehicles of dislocation motion. How do kinks interact with each other and with other lattice defects, including phonons? How does a distribution of kinks arise which shows up in the shape of dislocation lines frozen-in after deformation and observed in electron transmission? Semiconductor doping provides a unique possibility for manipulating the core structure of the dislocation in the D.S. and thus the Peierls potential. Its effect shows up microscopically in the dislocation dynamics as well as macroscopically in the deformation curves of D.S. crystals. The study of the charge on a dislocation in a doped semiconductor by measurement of its electrical properties discussed that may serve as a link in understanding the doping effects in dislocation dynamics.},

The viscoelastic properties (storage and loss modulus) were analyzed using dynamic mechanical analysis. The thermal diffusivity was measured using the laser flash technique. Combining thermal diffusivity data with specific heat and density allows calculation of the thermal conductivity of the polymer. Measurements were carried out from − 125 °C up to 150 °C. Additionally, measurements of the mechanical properties were carried out down to − 170 °C. The specific heat tests were conducted into the fully molten regions up to 370 °C.},

These composites were subjected to dynamic composites-made mechanical analysis and thermo gravimetric analysis. Results revealed that a significant improvement of 18\%, 14\% and 13\% was observed for storage and loss modulus and damping properties of polytetrafluroethylene-coated composite at low temperature region. The thermo gravimetric analysis results indicated a three-stage degradation for the polytetrafluroethylene-filled composites. Based on the acceptability from the literature, the tribo-test was performed only on the polytetrafluroethylene-coated composite for the selected PV limit of 400?MPa-mm/s (10 KN and 50?mm/s) in a flat-on-flat configuration. It was found that the influence of polytetrafluroethylene filler on the static and dynamic coefficient of friction and specific wear rate of the composite was more pronounced at dry wear test condition and it was found as 0.22, 0.12, and 4.87484?E-09, respectively. However, the results of improved storage and loss modulus and damping manifested negative correlation with the friction characteristics in the glassy region. Further, the SEM-coupled EDX spectral analysis was performed to understand the formation of transfer layer in counter surface. This polytetrafluroethylene blended composite is to be considered as an alternative to the bearing materials in offshore application.},

Increasing HFP content was found to, 1 depress the temperature of the crystal disordering transition. 2 increase the size and depress the temperature of the glass I peak 400° to 348°K. 3 decrease the size of the glass II peak. The temperature remined constant at 177°K. The glass I and II peaks were assigned to relaxation mechanisms involving long side branched and linear segments of the molecule and short linear segments, respectively. The depression of the crystal disordering transition was attributed to a decrease in the crystal lite size with increasing HFP content. An analogous glass I peak was observed in high density polyethylene at 333°K. in addition to the previously reported glass II peak at 156°K. Polypropylene exhibits glass I and II Peaks at 273° and 170°K. and two smaller peaks at 53° and 32°K due to hindered rotation of the methyl groups.

The low crystallinity samples show two relaxations: a very broad one (γ) centered at about −35°C. which appears to be split into two processes, and one (β) at 84°C. In the higher crystallinity samples, a third process (α) appears at about 137°C., and the high temperature side of the γ relaxation peak is lower in magnitude as compared to the lower crystallinity specimens. For the β peak, which is assumed to be associated with the glass transition, the peak value for G″ is essentially independent of crystallinity, while both Δ and J″ show decreases in magnitude with increasing crystallinity.

The crystallinity of the specimens varied form 48 to 92\%, and the measurements were made over a wide temperature range.

(0.60 cycle/sec.) and 399°K. (0.62 cycle/sec.). The crystallite relaxations occur at 291°K. (0.28 cycle/sec.) and the crystallite melting point, 600°K. It is concluded that the amorphous regions of polytetrafluoroethylene exist in three phases between 4.2°K. and the crystallite melting point. The supercooled liquid which exists below 600°K. is transformed into an amorphous solid at a temperature in the region of 400°K. This solid undergoes another transformation at approximately 176°K. to form a third phase which is stable down to 4.2°K. The crystallite realaxation centered at 291°K. consists of a series of disordering transitions including the well-known first-order transition. There is evidence that hindered rotation occurs within the crystallites at temperatures as low as 220°K.},

	abstract = {Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) has been used for many years in different application fields due to its outstanding chemical and physical properties. But, the value of its glass transition temperature is still today a matter of controversy and very different values are proposed in the literature. This paper proposes to answer to this scientific question using dynamic mechanical measurements. First, the viscoelastic properties of PTFE are described on a large temperature range and the influence of the shearing frequency is carefully investigated. Then, the effects produced by the polymer annealing on its thermomechanical behavior are detailed. This study comforts the idea that PTFE amorphous phase should be considered as comprised of two distinct regions. The first one named “mobile amorphous fraction” (MAF) is able to relax at low temperature (T=−103°C). The other one is specific of the macromolecular segments present at the boundaries between crystalline and amorphous domains. Due to the close vicinity of the crystallites, these macromolecular segments present a more restricted mobility. The corresponding phase is designated as the “rigid amorphous fraction” (RAF) and its mechanical relaxation produces itself at higher temperature (T=116°C). Actually, this latter value is strongly dependent on the material crystallinity degree. In particular, it is shifted to higher temperature after occurrence of a recrystallization that is accompanied by a further reduction of the RAF’s dynamic. Instead, the characteristics of the MAF relaxation are poorly affected. Tensile tests also support that the “real” Tg of the polymer is located at low temperature. All these results have been compared to those of the literature to propose a real scientific discussion and to understand the origin of somewhat contradictory interpretations.},

The research showed that as a result of aging, the amount of the crystalline phase increases by about 8\%, which translates into the properties of the aged material. The glass transition and melt temperature of lamellar crystals formed during first and second crystallisation increase with aging. The mechanical properties of the material were analysed in the temperature range of 25 to 75 °C. The tests were showing an increase in Young’s modulus and a decrease in elongation at the break as a result of aging. This phenomenon was particularly visible during tests at 75 °C and during the morphological observation of the fracture surface, where the fracture character of the material changes from ductile to brittle. In the case of the material aged for the longest time, the temperature has a negligible influence on the elongation at break.},

In order to establish the  method for this system, model specimens were prepared by bonding together the films of  polymers of known size, and  modulus E' and loss modulus E" were measured at 138c/s over a  range from -170°C to 120°C. The film of polyvinyl  (PVC) and that of nitrile-butadiene rubber (NBR) were used as materials of the model specimens. The results of measurements were compared with the values calculated from  properties of component polymers.Close agreement was obtained between the observed values of E' and E" of various types of model specimens and the values calculated by the equation, in which the volume fraction and  form were taken into .As  of the two phase system, Cycolac H of Marbon Chem. Co. was studied. Its temperature dispersion curve resembles  to that of model specimen, which was constructed by putting the rubber phase (NBR) into  phase (PVC). The location of the higher temperature dispersion of Cycolac H, 115°C, accorded with that of the dispersion of a styrene-acrylonitrile copolymer separately measured. The lower temperature dispersion at -185°C was found to correspond to that of polybutadiene. The dispersion curves of Cycolac H were successfully calculated by employing those of the component polymers based upon the two phase simple model.As an example of molecularly mixed system, the measurements were performed on the specimens prepared from PVC and NBR of various compositions by the solvent casting method with tetrahydrofuran. Of all the compositions, only one main absorption was found at the temperature region between the absorptions of PVC and NBR. The shape of absorption becomes most broad at the intermediate compositions. This broadness is considered to be due to the microheterogeneity in segmental size, corresponding to the varieties of segmental environment. The general expression for this case was presented.The shape of temperature dispersion curve for the partially miscible system showed an intermediate form between those of the typical two phase system and the molecularly mixed system. The behavior of blends of a styrene-acrylonitrile copolymer and NBR belongs to this type. Observed values for this system were compared with the values calculated on the basis of the typical two phase system of the same compositions. Definite deviations from calculated values were found, which were duly ascribed to the portion of molecularly mixed phase. Broadening of absorptions of both rubber and plastic phases could not be interpreted from the typical two phase model, but only from the consideration of the effect of molecularly mixing.This circumstances were ascertained by the behavior of the model specimen specifically prepared for this purpose.},

The temperature dependence of complex moduli of the crystalline polymers with various degrees of crystallinity is illustrated by using the model. On the basis of the model, we have derived an equation for calculating the strain-optical coefficient of the crystalline polymer from those of the crystalline and the non-crystalline phase. The equation gives a relation among the rheo-optical quantities, the viscoelastic quantities and the parameters representing the fine structure and the crystallinity of the polymer. It is concluded from this equation that the strain optical coefficients cannot be expressed by such a simple additive relation as usually employed.},

The changes in the first melting temperature are caused by radiation-induced links that decrease the melt entropy and increase the flod surface free-energy-per-unit area of chain-folded polyethylene crystals. These effects are dependent on the lamellar thickness distribution and on the types of links formed (intramolecular or intermolecular).

The method utilizes a computer-aided video extensometer which analyses the sample profile in real time. The effective strain is computed automatically from the minimum diameter, and the effective stress is deduced from the applied load by taking into account the stress triaxiality corresponding to the local radius of curvature of the sample profile. Furthermore, a digital closed-loop system controls the ram speed of the hydraulic tensile testing machine in such a way that the local effective strain rate is maintained at a constant value. It is shown that most polymeric and metallic materials are entitled to be investigated by this method, which gives access in real time to the constitutive plastic equation, up to strains far beyond the necking point. The capabilities of the technique are illustrated and discussed critically, with more details for two polymers of different structures: polyethylene and polycarbonate.},

  abstract = {The need to model fracture in crashworthiness by means of finite element codes is a real challenge for research. Before implementing fracture criteria, an excellent knowledge of the stress and strain states in the material just before the crack appearance is the first condition necessary to ensure the model development. At present, most of the material behaviour laws, for example for steel, are only defined until the maximum force when necking occurs. For polymers, the early occurrence of the diffuse necking leads to an experimental technique in which the speed loading is controlled in real time to maintain a constant strain rate during the test. This technique is not however used, due to technical limitations, for high strain rate behaviour laws. In this paper, the authors propose to use the heterogeneity of the displacement field on the surface of the tensile specimen as an initial condition to identify behaviour laws. The method developed uses the information in all the surface zone of the specimen by using digital image correlation. Stresses, strains and strain rates are then obtained to build a surface behaviour called the SE\.E surface. By cutting it, the experimental behaviour laws for a range of large strains and strain rates are then defined for model identification.},

In particular the existence of a limiting dislocation velocity, coupled with an upper limit on dislocation density, provides an upper bound on the dislocation flux. Thus, the plastic strain rate in polycrystalline metals must also be bounded in many cases of interest. This physical situation can be idealized by postulating transition functions from zero to maximum flux in as simple as possible a manner consistent with the problem under investigation and the solution features to be examined. A drastic transition function is given here which leads to multiaxial stress, strain, strain-rate relations of reasonable simplicity and these are illustrated by application to several example problems. A common feature of the solutions of the examples treated is that the material response is partly rate dependent and partly rate independent. This indicates that the corresponding physical situations are characterized by large dislocation fluxes during part of the time and very small fluxes at other times.},

	abstract = {Ce travail est une contribution à l'étude de la plasticité en traction uniaxiale des polyéthylènes entre la température de la transition vitreuse et la fusion cristalline. L'étude systématique de 3 copolymères d'éthylène/1-butène couvrant la plage de cristallinité [0. 65-0. 35] a permis d'élucider les mécanismes complexes de l'écoulement plastique par le biais de mesures de contrainte-déformation vraies couplées à une analyse structurale de la déformation. La formation de la striction s'accompagne d'un gradient de vitesse de déformation et développe des contraintes normales le long du profil de la striction. La propagation de l'instabilité plastique s'effectue à partir des régions concaves de l'épaule de striction ou les chaînes adoptent une orientation préférentielle oblique. Il apparaît en outre que le système de glissement préférentiel dans le polyéthylène sphérolitique est (010)[001]. L'orientation progressive de l'axe des chaînes dans la direction d'étirage est responsable du durcissement et conduit à la stabilisation de la striction. La plasticité des polyéthylènes est gouvernée par deux mécanismes de déformation plastique : l'un homogène, l'autre hétérogène. Le mécanisme homogène est un cisaillement des lamelles cristallines dans les plans (010). Il est caractérisé par une consolidation élevée et des paramètres d'activation thermique relativement faibles. Son amorçage est contrôlé par l'épaisseur des lamelles cristallines. Ce mécanisme est étroitement lié aux mobilités moléculaires mises en jeu dans la relaxation cristalline. Le mécanisme hétérogène correspond à un glissement localisé dans la lamelle cristalline. Il est caractérisé par une faible consolidation et dépend moins de la température et de la cristallinité que le précédent. Le caractère compétitif de ces deux mécanismes suggère qu'ils sont situés dans des régions distinctes des lamelles cristallines.

	abstract = {En dessous de la transition vitreuse, pour des vitesses moyennes de deformation, le suivi de la deformation volumique en traction et la non influence de la pression hydrostatique sur les seuils d'ecoulement plastique obtenus pour differents chemins de chargement montrent que le comportement du polyamide 11 est tres proche de celui des metaux. Les mecanismes de creation et de propagation de bandes de cisaillement intervenant dans la deformation de la phase amorphe du pa11 peuvent etre assimiles a ceux de propagation de dislocations dans les metaux. Cependant, le pa11 acquiert un comportement radicalement different de celui des metaux lorsqu'il est soumis a des conditions favorables aux mecanismes diffusionnels de deformation. Ainsi, toujours en dessous de la transition vitreuse mais pour des vitesses lentes de deformation, des phenomenes de relaxation sensibles a la pression hydrostatique vont se produire autour des bandes de cisaillement de la phase amorphe vitreuse et la recouvrance des deformations va etre retardee. Au dessus de la temperature de transition vitreuse, la deformation de la phase amorphe caoutchoutique s'effectue par diffusion sans engendrer aucune variation de volume ni subir aucune influence de la pression hydrostatique. La recouvrance tres longue traduira la nature entropique de cette deformation},

	abstract = {The methods of conventional tensile testing as applied to solid polymers are compared and reviewed critically. Experiments were performed using these techniques, and it is shown that large variations in local strain rate occur while necking and cold-drawing take place. A new tensile testing method is described in which the samples are tested atconstant local true strain rate. This technique is based on the use of a diameter transducer, an exponential voltage generator and a closed-loop testing machine. Flow curves for poly(vinyl chloride) and high density polyethylene were determined at room temperature over the strain rate range of 10−1 to 10−4 sec−1. It is shown that the flow behaviour of these two polymers can be approximated by the constitutive relation:\$\${\textbackslash}sigma  = K {\textbackslash}cdot {\textbackslash}exp [({\textbackslash}gamma \_ {\textbackslash}in  /2) {\textbackslash}in {\textasciicircum}2 ] {\textbackslash}cdot {\textbackslash}dot  {\textbackslash}in {\textasciicircum}m\$\$, whereK andγ∈are constants andm, the rate sensitivity, is in the range 0.02 to 0.06. It is concluded that the positive curvature of the log σ flow curve is responsible for the stabilization of flow localization associated with cold drawing, and that the rate sensitivity plays a much smaller role.},

	abstract = {The large strain deformation response of amorphous polymers results primarily from orientation of the molecular chains within the polymeric material during plastic straining. Molecular network orientation is a highly anisotropic process, thus the observed mechanical response is strongly a function of the anisotropic state of these materials. Through mechanical testing and material characterization, the nature of the evolution of molecular orientation under different conditions of state of strain is developed. The role of developing anisotropy on the mechanical response of these materials is discussed in the context of assessing the capabilities of several models to predict the state of deformation-dependent response. A three-dimensional rubber elasticity spring system that is capable of capturing the state of deformation dependence of strain hardening is used to develop a tensorial internal state variable model of the evolving anisotropic polymer response. This fully three-dimensional constitutive model is shown to be successfully predictive of the true stress vs. true strain data obtained in our isothermal uniaxial compression and plane strain compression experiments on amorphous polycarbonate (PC) and polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) at moderate strain rates. A basis is established for providing the polymer designer with the ability to predict the flow strengths and deformation patterns of highly anisotropic materials. A companion paper by Arruda, Boyce, and Quintus-Bosz [in press] shows how the model developed herein is used to predict various anisotropic aspects of the large strain mechanical response of preoriented materials. Additional work has been done to extend the model to include the effects of strain rate and temperature in Arruda, Jayachandran, and Boyce [in press].},

The experiments were conducted isothermally at 84 °C, which is in the glass transition region, and at 90 °C, above Tg. The stress-strain behaviour is qualitatively different at the two temperatures. At the lower temperature, there is an initial stiff response followed by a decrease in slope suggestive of yielding, whereas this effect is absent at 90 °C. There is strain rate dependence at both temperatures, with stress simply related to the logarithm of the shear rate. To model the behaviour above the glass transition, strain rate dependence is included in a network model; the alternative of a time independent network acting in parallel with a yielding process is found to be inadequate. At the lower temperature, however, there is a need for such a process acting in parallel with the time dependent network in order to predict adequately the initial shapes of the stress-strain curves. The resulting constitutive equations provide very good representations at both temperatures.},

	abstract = {The constitutive behaviour of amorphous polymers near the glass transition contains many features general to this class of materials. A new, physically based, three-dimensional constitutive model has been developed for simulating this wide range of features in models of polymer products and processes. In particular, the model displays glassy response at low temperatures and short time-scales, and rubber-like response at high temperatures and long time-scales, and is therefore an example of a glass-rubber constitutive model. Its basis is the assumed additivity of free energies of bond distortion and conformation perturbation. For the elastic bond distortion stress-strain law and flow model, and the conformational entropy function, the model employs linear elasticity, Eyring viscous flow and the Edwards-Vilgis entropy function, respectively. Glass structure and temperature dependence are introduced through the Vogel-Tammann-Fulcher and Arrhenius equations for viscosity, respectively. With parameters obtained for poly(ethylene terephthalate) in a companion paper, the model was solved numerically to simulate a variety of uniaxial strain sequences, and found to replicate well the characteristic patterns of behaviour of amorphous polymers in the temperature region of interest, over a wide range of experimental situations from small to large strains. The only major deficiency, resulting from the simplifying assumption of a single activation barrier height, is its being too localized in the time domain. At high temperatures and long times, applicability of the model is limited by the onset of conformational relaxation.},

Eulerian and Lagrangian type formulations of these balance equations are given, and the closed-form analytical solution for the so-called Chain Orientation Distribution Function is derived. This full network model is then used to describe the large strain inelastic behaviour of rubber-like materials. Detailed comparisons with experimental results and with two approximate models, namely the classical three-chain model and a very recently proposed eight-chain model, are provided for different types of deformation and rubbers. Finally, the network model is applied to describe the orientational hardening in amorphous glassy polymers, and confronted with experimental data for polycarbonate.

A range of 12 linear atactic polystyrenes was studied: monodisperse, bimodal blends, and a polydisperse commercial sample. Mn varied between 66,000 and 490,000 g/mol. These were given standardized thermal treatments and then subjected to uniaxial compression tests in the glassy state over the temperature range 40 to 95 °C and nominal strain-rates 10−4 to 10−3 s−1. Their constitutive responses were interpreted in terms of the physically based three-dimensional constitutive model for small or large deformations in amorphous polymers proposed earlier (Polymer 1995, 36, 3301–3312), including plastic strain-induced structural rejuvenation. In multimode form, the model captured closely both linear viscoelastic response and yield and plastic flow. When the reduction of Vogel temperature caused by chain ends was incorporated in the model, it predicted a fall in yield stress with reducing molecular length. This was also observed in experimental data, with the rate of fall approximately in agreement. The results provide further support for the model as a unifying framework for describing the physical properties of polymer glasses. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

	abstract = {Creep age forming (CAF) is an advanced forming technology that combines creep deformation and age hardening processes. When compared with the conventional forming technologies including roll bending and shot-peen forming, CAF has many advantages of low residual stress, excellent dimensional stability, good service performance and short production cycle. It is an optimal technique for precise manufacturing for shape and properties of large-scale complicated thin-walled components of light-weight and high strength aluminum alloys in the aviation and aerospace industries. Nevertheless, CAF has an inevitable disadvantage that a large amount of springback occurs after unloading, which brings a challenge on the accurate shape forming and property tailoring of components. Therefore, how to achieve accurate prediction and control of springback has always been a bottleneck hindering the development of CAF to more industrial applications. After the factors of affecting springback and measures of reducing springback are summarized from the internal and external aspects, constitutive models for predicting springback and springback compensation methods for CAF of aluminum alloy panel components are reviewed. Then, a review of research progresses on tool design for CAF is presented. Finally, in view of the key issue that it is difficult to predict and control the shape and properties of components during CAF, the technical challenges are discussed and future development trends of CAF are prospected.
A new practical modeling of the Norton's power law creep is proposed and implemented to analyze the high temperature behaviors of Alloy 690 SG tube material. In the model, both the stress exponent n and the rate constant B are simply treated as the temperature dependent parameters. Based on the two-step optimization procedure, the temperature function of the rate constant B(T) was determined for the data set of each B value after fixing the stress exponent n value by using the prior optimized function at each temperature. This procedure could significantly reduce the numerical errors when using the power law creep equations. Based on the better description of the steady-state creep rates, the experimental rupture times could also be well predicted by using the Monkman-Grant relationship. Furthermore, the difference in tensile strengths at high temperatures could be very well estimated by assuming the imaginary creep stress related to the given strain rate after correcting the temperature effects on the elastic modulus.
A phenomenological analysis for predicting the long-term creep life of high temperature materials at different temperatures using model parameters derived from short-term creep tests is presented. The model invokes Maxwell-Boltzmann temperature dependence, as rigorously developed in a recent analysis pertaining to the power law domain and a modified form of the Monkman-Grant hypothesis for isothermal conditions. In addition, the model provides, by pattern recognition, suitable weighting factors for the role of strain rate and temperature. The result is a material-dependent analysis which uses only short-term creep test data but is able to predict accurately both the short- and long-term creep behaviour of several complex creep-resistant alloys. This analysis is validated using reliable and accurate creep data taken from NIMS (National Institute of Materials Science, Japan) database pertaining to 10 industrial, high temperature alloys. The consistency or otherwise of the predictions is examined and the importance of the weighting factors in ensuring accurate predictions is emphasized.
Titanium and its alloys are extensively used in a variety of high performance applications with the α + β alloy, Ti-6Al-4V, being the most popular. Conventionally Ti alloys in the as-cast condition possess highly coarse prior β grains, whose size is in the order of {\textasciitilde}mm. Such large grain sizes not only reduce the strength of the alloy, but also impair its workability. The addition of about 0.1\% wt.\% B can result marked reduction in the grain size. The advantages offered by microstructural refinements, thus induced by trace addition of B in Ti alloys, are reviewed in this paper. Processing response of the as-cast alloys improved as a result of grain refinement due to B addition, leading to the possibility of removal or minimization of primary ingot breakdown steps. This can significantly bring down the cost of the finished Ti alloys components. Microstructural refinements with B addition on the mechanical performance of the alloys both at room and elevated temperatures are reviewed with emphasis on the microstructure-property correlations.
Hydrogen embrittlement (HE) substantially deteriorates the mechanical properties of metals. The HE behavior of nanograined (NG) materials with a high fraction of grain boundaries (GBs) may significantly differ from those of their coarse-grained counterparts. Herein, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed to investigate the HE behavior and mechanism of NG α-Fe under creep loading. The effects of temperature, sustained stress, and grain size on the creep mechanism was examined based on the Mukherjee-Bird-Dorn (MBD) equation. The deformation mechanisms were found to be highly dependent on temperature, applied stress, and grain size. Hydrogen charging was found to have an inhibitory effect on the GB-related deformation mechanism. As the grain size increased, the HE mechanism transitioned from H-induced inhibition of GB-related deformation to H-enhanced GB decohesion. The current results might provide theoretical guidance for designing NG structural materials with low HE sensitivity and better mechanical performance.
Creep is an inevitable problem in the design and maintenance of modern high-temperature machinery. Accurate understanding of the mechanism and law of material creep failure is the basis of structural creep performance evaluation. The microstructure of GH4169 alloy after creep at 873.15 K and 923.15 K was analyzed by OM, SEM, EBSD and EDS. In addition, the effect of different grain sizes on the creep behavior of the material and the ability of the phenomenological model to describe the creep curve are also discussed. The results show that there are inclusions formed by Nb and Ti inside the alloy, and local stress concentration is caused during the creep deformation and crack propagation, which leads to the initiation of microcracks or voids. The microstructure of the material before the third stage of creep or far away from the creep fracture is not much different from the original material. The initiation and propagation of cracks and crystal slip mainly occur near the fracture surface. During the creep process, oxygen will combine with aluminum element on the surface of the material to form an alumina layer, and cracks are mainly initiated at the interface between the oxide layer and the matrix. When the crack penetrates the oxide layer, oxide particles will be formed on the grain boundary. The grain size studied in this paper have little effect on the creep strain and rate curves. The results of grain refinement are mainly reflected in the slight increase of creep fracture strain and life. The constitutive model used according to the creep failure process of the material can describe the whole creep curve.
The primary components in pressurised water reactors are manufactured by welding thick sections of either SA508 or SA533 pressure vessel steel using processes such as submerged arc welding (SAW) or gas-tungsten arc welding (GTAW). Narrow-groove (NG) variants of these processes have reduced welding times, but thick-section welds still require a large number of passes. In this work, the effects of a large number of welding thermal cycles on the through-thickness variability in microstructure and mechanical properties have been analysed for NG-GTAW and NG-SAW joints made in 78 mm thick SA533 steel. Microstructures were characterised using optical and scanning electron microscopy, while mechanical properties were captured in cross-weld tensile tests using digital image correlation and through tests on coupons extracted exclusively from the weld metal and from the heat-affected zone. Charpy impact testing was used to assess toughness. While the toughness was relatively consistent throughout the SAW joint, significant through-thickness variations in toughness were observed in the NG-GTAW joint, which can be attributed to the varying degree to which the weldment was tempered by subsequent welding thermal cycles.
Hydrogen trapping at metal/carbide interfaces is changed with changing interfacial composition. This has been exemplified for the iron/vanadium carbide (VC) interface. It will be assumed that the carbide interface is a (100)-plane having a composition between the limiting cases of either 50\% V and 50\% C for excess carbon in iron or 50\% V and 50\% carbon-vacancies for excess vanadium in iron. The latter will provide strong traps for hydrogen. For validating the simple model a modified interpretation of published atom probe and thermal desorption data became necessary as discussed in the present work.
Accurate tritium transport properties of prospective tritium permeation barriers (TPBs) are essential to tritium systems in fusion reactors. By passing a temperature and rate-controlled sweeping gas over specimen surfaces to carry the permeated tritium to an ion chamber, the gas-driven permeation of tritium has been performed on 321 type stainless steel containers with Al2O3/FeAl barriers, to determine the T-permeation resistant performance and mechanism of the barrier. The tritium permeability of the Al2O3/FeAl coated container was reduced by 3 orders of magnitude at 500–700 °C by contrast with that of the bare one, which meets the requirement of the tritium permeation reduction factor (PRF) of TPBs for tritium operating components in the CN-HCCB TBM. The Al2O3/FeAl barrier resists the tritium permeation by the diffusion in the bulk substrate at a limited number of defect sites with an effective area and thickness, suggesting that the TPB quality is a very important factor for efficient T-permeation resistance.
Ferritic creep-resistant steel, according to ASME Code case Grade 92 (Gr.92), contains 9\%Cr (chromium). It has a high creep rupture strength at 600°C for 100 000 h, and is therefore a suitable material for long-term use in a high-temperature and pressure steam circulating coal-fired power plant. The mechanical, physical and creep properties are introduced and explained in this chapter. Creep strength prognostication, and its optimization through experimentally designed chemical composition, is covered and the field test records are also explained.
The landscape of energy production and use is facing great challenges in the transportation sectors. The two main means of transportation, automobiles and airplanes, are mainly made from metals. The necessity of reducing their carbon emission translates into major stakes for weight reduction, which can only be the result of an interplay between improving the alloys and the part's geometry. This contribution discusses some of the strategies for structural weight reduction based on innovative alloy design in aluminum alloys and steels and on innovative processing by additive manufacturing.
Le paysage de la production d'énergie et de son utilisation est confronté à des défis importants dans le secteur des transports. Les deux principaux moyens de transport, automobile et aérien, sont principalement fabriqués avec des métaux. La nécessité de réduire leurs émissions de CO2 se traduit par une exigence majeure d'allègement, qui ne peut résulter que d'une action conjuguée d'amélioration des alliages et de la géométrie des pièces. Cette contribution discute certaines des stratégies pour l'allègement des structures basées sur la conception innovante d'alliages d'aluminium et d'aciers et sur les procédés innovants par fabrication additive.
The microstructure evolution and carbide precipitation in a Ti-46Al-8Nb-0.7C alloy as well as its creep properties at intermediate temperatures are investigated by high-energy X-ray diffraction and electron microscopy. The alloy with a nearly fully lamellar microstructure exhibits excellent creep resistance, which could be attributed to the good microstructural stability and strengthening effects from both P- and H-carbides. It is also found that the creep parameters have different effects on the precipitation of the carbides. The overall volume fraction of the carbides shows a positive correlation with the creep temperature and time. However, the thermal stability of P-carbides in the γ grain interior decreases at a higher creep temperature. The creep stress hardly affects the precipitation and morphology development of the P-carbides. On the contrary, a higher stress can promote the H-carbide formation at the γ/α2 interfaces via α2 lath decomposition in lamellar colonies.},

A raft made of a randomized mixture of two different sizes of bubbles in roughly equal numbers has many structural characteristics of a metallic glass and can serve as a quantitatively accurate analog for it. The two-dimensional pair distribution function of such a raft resembles those in glassy metals. In addition this structure permits a simple definition of free area as a two-dimensional analog of free volume and the accurate determination of its distribution. When sheared the rafts are observed to change shape by a collection of very local shear transformations. These transformations are in the nature of either relatively equiaxed regions of about 5 bubble diameters undergoing complex internal rearrangements or are in the form of two-dimensional slip patches involving sharp shear translations of two adjacent nearly close packed bubble rows that are about 5 bubbles in length. These observations lead by analogy to the postulate that in metallic glasses the corresponding three-dimensional processes are also shear transformations in correspondingly small volume elements. These are either in the form of equiaxed regions undergoing some redundant internal rearrangements of atoms imposed by the specific disordered structure or are in the form of very narrow pennyshaped shear transformations resembling dislocation loops.},

	abstract = {Glassy polymers are extensively used as high impact resistant, low density, and clear materials in industries. Due to the lack of the long-range order in the microstructures of glassy solids, plastic deformation is different from that in crystalline solids. Shear transformation zones (STZs) are believed to be the plasticity carriers in amorphous solids and defined as the localized atomic or molecular deformation patches induced by shear. Despite a great effort in characterizing these local disturbance regions in metallic glasses (MGs), there are still many unknowns relating to the microstructural and micromechanical characteristics of STZs in glassy polymers. This chapter is aimed at investigating the flow phenomenon in polycarbonate (PC) and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) as glassy polymers and obtaining the mechanical and geometrical characteristics of their STZs. To achieve this goal, the nanoindentation experiments are performed on samples with two different thermal histories: as-cast and annealed, and temperature and strain rate dependency of the yield stress of PC and PMMA are studied. Based on the experimental results, it is showed that the flow in PC and PMMA is a homogeneous phenomenon at tested temperatures and strain rates. The homogeneous flow theory is then applied to analyze the STZs quantitatively. The achieved results are discussed for their possible uniqueness or applicability to all glassy polymers in the context of amorphous plasticity.},

Résumé
On introduit une carte empirique de la déformation des verres métalliques et l'on passe en revue les deux modes de déformation, l'écoulement homogène et l'écoulement hétérogène. Le mécanisme microscopique de l'écoulement hétérogène en régime permanent repose sur un équilibre dynamique entre la création produite par la contrainte et l'annihilation par diffusion du désordre structural. On utilise un formalisme dans lequel le volume libre est considéré comme paramètre d'ordre. On calcule dans la carte de la déformation la ligne de séparation des régions d'écoulement homogène et hétérogène. Les relations contrainte-déformation en écoulement hétérogène sont proches du comportement idéalement plastique.
Zusammenfassung
Eine empirische Verformungskarte wird für metallische Gläser eingeführt; zwei Arten der Verformung, homogenes und inhomogenes Flieβen, werden besprochen. Der mikroskopische Mechanismus des stationären inhomogenen Flieβens baut auf einem dynamischen Gleichgewicht zwischen spannungsgetriebener Erzeugung der strukturellen Unordnung und ihrer Annihilation durch Diffusion auf. Der Formalismus wird mit der freien Energie als Ordnungsparameter entwickelt Die Grenzlinie zwischen Gebieten homogenen und inhomogenen Flieβens in der Verformungskarte wird berechnet. Die Spannungs-Dehnungsbeziehung bei inhomogenem Flieβen kommt ideal plastischem Verhalten nahe.},

In addition, thermodynamical constraints should be taken into account, which is not obvious in many theories. In the previous section, heterogeneity is linked to the real microstructure, like “cells” in the Mindlin theory. One possibility to bring thermodynamics directly into modelling of dynamical phenomena is provided by the concept of internal variables. The idea of internal variables can be traced back to P.

A full characterization of all these complex features involves prominent efforts in terms of material testing and parameter identification (PI). The contribution of the crystalline phase plays an important role in the evolution of the plastic yield in the SCPs. In this work, a constitutive model, named Unified SCP (USCP), is proposed by modifying the physically-based Boyce–Parks–Argon (BPA) glassy model. The contribution of the crystalline phase is introduced in the strain softening/hardening evolution law of the strength, providing an alternative interpretation of the underlying morphological changes caused by the crystalline phase embedded in the amorphous phase. The proposed formulation extends the BPA model with a new contribution to capture the crystalline phase. A full thermo-mechanical coupled numerical framework is developed for the USCP model validation. The DY phenomenon at different strain rates with self-heating and thermal softening effects is investigated and predicted. The proposed model extension needs three material constants with clear physical meaning. To identify them, a fast in-house optimization process based on Nelder–Mead is used, in which only a single element test is required. The model accurately predicts the experimental results for both thermosets and thermoplastics such as epoxy, nylon 101, PA6 and LDPE under monotonic loadings reported by different authors.},

	abstract = {The double yield (DY) phenomenon observed in a wide variety of semi-crystalline polymers (SCP) adds difficulties in the material characterization. In this paper, a constitutive model, termed as explicit semi-crystalline polymer (ESCP) model, is proposed to study DY phenomenon as well as the rate- and temperature-dependent thermomechanical response below the glass transition temperature. The underlying yield kinetics due to the morphological changes of the spherulite micro-structure is represented by a rheological analogue described by a physicallybased amorphous intermolecular resistance and a rate-independent crystalline interlamellar resistance. Independently-identified viscoelastic response and network resistance are also implemented to complete the model description. The activation and disclosure of the crystalline component depend on the saturated state of amorphous phase. The proposed model is validated against experimental data obtained from different authors for three commonly used SCPs: nylon 101, LDPE and PA6. A straightforward parameter identification procedure, requiring a minimum number of calibration tests, is presented to illustrate the model usage. The thermomechanical-coupled analyses provide satisfactory predictions using simulated models of a cylinder compression and dogbone tensile tests at different rates, where the self-heating and thermal softening effects are naturally captured by the model.},

Résumé
On montre que des relations constitutives pour la contrainte et le flux énergétique, déduites de l'équation de Boltzman par la méthode de Chapman-Enskog, violent le principe de l'indifférence du matériau, tout en présentant l'état d'invariance dans les transformations de galilée.
Zusammenfassung
Es wird gezeigt, dass Konstitutivbeziehungen für Spannungs- und Energiefluss, die durch das Chapman-Enskog'sche Verfahren aus den Boltzmann-Gleichungen abgeleitet werden, gegen das Prinzip von Materialindifferenz anstossen, während sie unter Galilei'schen Transformationen Invarianz zeigen.
Sumàrio
Si dimostra come i rapporti costitutive per il flusso di energia e di sollecitazione, derivati dall' equazione di Boltzman con la procedura di Chapman-Enskog violino il principio dell'indifferenza materiale pur mostrando invarianza nelle transformazioni di Galilei.

	abstract = {A method for homogenization of linear or non-linear (finite strain) thermoelastic random composites is presented. With the help of variational principles, the method leads to hierarchies of scale-dependent bounds on constitutive responses, which are illustrated in several cases through computational mechanics. This, in turn, provides estimates of the minimal size of the Representative Volume Element (RVE). The effects of mismatch between the composite's phases as well as the temperature difference on the minimal size of the RVE are also considered. The results of linear and non-linear thermoelasticity theories are compared.},
