The response of a liner viscoelastic material to a complex stess history can be calculated from the step-function response, but this is not so for plastics which are non-liner viscoelastic. The paper considers this from a mainly experimental viewpoint and underlines the general inadequacy of the current continuum echanical approach. The sections on recovery and intermittent stressing are of particular practical importance since it is under these conditions that plastic display particulary useful characteristics.},

A general anisotropic form and a specific isotropic formulation are proposed. A yield condition is not part of the theory and the transition from linear (elastic) to nonlinear (inelastic) behavior is continuous. Only total strains are used and the constant volume hypothesis is not employed. In this paper Poisson's ratio is assumed to be constant. The proposed equation can represent: initial linear elastic behavior; initial elastic response in torsion (tension) after arbitrary prestrain (prestress) in tension (torsion); linear elastic behavior for pure hydrostatic loading; initial elastic slope upon large instantaneous changes in strain rate; stress (strain)-rate sensitivity; creep and relaxation; defined behavior in the limit of very slow and very fast loading. Stress-strain curves obtained at different loading rates will ultimately have the same ``slope'' and their spacing is nonlinearly related to the loading rate.},

  abstract = {A previously proposed, uniaxial differential constitutive equation (E.R. Cernocky and E. Krempl, 1979a, b), nonlinear in the Cauchy stress and the engineering strain but linear in the stress and strain-rates, is specialized to an overstress model. It is shown by qualitative arguments that the solutions correspond to typical room-temperature viscoplastic behavior of AISI type 304 stainless steel. Two unknown coefficient functions are determined by extrapolation of room temperature relaxation data for this steel. The stiff first-order nonlinear differential equations are then numerically integrated for a variety of test histories. These include strain control with strain-rates from 10-6 to 800s-1, stress control with stressrates from 1.95 kPa s-1 to 19.5 MPa s-1, instantaneous large changes in strain-rate and stress-rate, and partial unloading and reloading in strain and stress control and tension-tension cyclic creep. The computed results show good qualitative agreement with tests. Based on these results we consider that the model is a good representation of metal deformation behavior as long as the overstress does not change sign.},

After being improved with experimental observations, the rheological model of Zener was used to model the viscoelastic behavior of PP. As for viscoplastic behavior modeling, it was based on the characterization of the mechanical behavior performed in the first part of the study. Attention was focused on the strain reversal in order to predict the unloading path. Experimental data from the performed mechanical tests were employed to determine the parameters of the viscoelastoplastic model.},

A simple polycrystalline model is constructed which precisely satisfies local kinematic constraints as well as global compatibility. Volume-average global stresses are obtained by approximating the local constraint stress as the corresponding projection of the (to-be-determined) global stress. Applications of the model to hexagonal crystals without pyramidal slip, and to large deformation and texturing of orthorhombic polycrystalline materials (olivine; HDPE) are made.},

The underlying principle is that the history of deformation is defined in terms of a time scale which is not measured by a clock, but is in itself a property of the material at hand. The theory is unifying in the sense that theories of plasticity, viscoelasticity and elasticity can be obtained from it as special cases by imposing suitable constraints on the material parameters involved furthermore, it does not make use of the idea of a yield surface.},

“In this work, the large deformation behaviour under monotonic loading and unloading of a high density polyethylene (HDPE) is studied.” (Ayoub et al., 2010, p. 329)“To analyze the nonlinear time-dependent response of the material, mechanical tests were conducted at room temperature under constant true strain rates and stress relaxation conditions.” (Ayoub et al., 2010, p. 329)“A physically-based inelastic model written under finite strain formulation is proposed to describe the mechanical behaviour of HDPE. In the model, the inelastic mechanisms involve two parallel elements: a visco-hyperelastic network resistance acting in parallel with a viscoelastic–viscoplastic intermolecular resistance where the amorphous and crystalline phases are explicitly taken into consideration. The semicrystalline polymer is considered as a two-phase composite.” (Ayoub et al., 2010, p. 329)“The influence of the crystallinity on the loading and unloading behaviour is investigated.” (Ayoub et al., 2010, p. 329)“To demonstrate the improved modelling capabilities, simulations are also performed using the original model of Boyce et al. [Boyce, M.C., Socrate, S., Llana, P.G., 2000. Constitutive model for the finite deformation stress–strain behavior of poly(ethylene terephthalate) above the glass transition. Polymer 41, 2183–2201] modified by Ahzi et al. [Ahzi, S., Makradi, A., Gregory, R.V., Edie, D.D., 2003. Modeling of deformation behavior and strain-induced crystallization in poly(ethylene terephthalate) above the glass transition temperature. Mechanics of Materials 35, 1139–1148].” (Ayoub et al., 2010, p. 329)“Polymers are used in a large range of applications, including aerospace and automotive industries, fluid transport and electronics.” (Ayoub et al., 2010, p. 329)“Polymers present a very complex nonlinear behaviour depending on external factors (such as triaxiality, strain rate and temperature) and structural parameters (such as crystallinity degree, molecular weights and crosslinking).” (Ayoub et al., 2010, p. 329)“Two approaches are usually used to develop constitutive models for polymers: either physically-based or phenomenologically-based.” (Ayoub et al., 2010, p. 329)“The physical approach is usually used to describe the behaviour of amorphous polymers while the phenomenological approach is usually applied to study semicrystalline polymers.” (Ayoub et al., 2010, p. 330)“Using this concept, Nikolov and Doghri (2000) and Nikolov et al. (2002) presented a micromechanical modelling to predict the small deformation behaviour of HDPE. van Dommelen et al. (2003) proposed a micromechanical modelling to simulate the elastic–viscoplastic behaviour and texture evolution of semicrystalline polymers at moderate strain level. The modelling introduced a rate and temperature dependence on the strain hardening resulting from molecular orientation. The model has the ability to describe qualitatively the stress–strain behaviour of HDPE. However, the results were presented without experimental comparisons.” (Ayoub et al., 2010, p. 330)“Although these models can reproduce in an acceptable way the large deformation elastic–viscoplastic response of polymers, they do not take into account the nonlinear response of these materials under unloading. To fill in this gap a number of constitutive equations were developed, the most of them through the infinitesimal deformation framework” (Ayoub et al., 2010, p. 330)“More recently, Dusunceli and Colak (2008) extended the Krempl model by incorporating the effect of crystallinity degree.” (Ayoub et al., 2010, p. 330)“The physically-based elastic–viscoplastic model proposed by Boyce et al. (2000) and Ahzi et al. (2003) was adopted and extended to develop a plausible constitutive model for describing the mechanical behaviour of semicrystalline polymers. In particular, the original model was modified to directly incorporate the nonlinear viscosity effects in the elastic part.” (Ayoub et al., 2010, p. 330)},

“The mechanical stress–strain behaviour of polyethylene (PE) materials under finite strains is studied both experimentally and theoretically.” (Ayoub et al., 2011, p. 492)“In order to gain insight into the structure and physical properties of investigated PE materials, a series of thermal (DSC and DMTA) and microstructural (small-angle X-ray scattering and AFM) characterizations have been undertaken.” (Ayoub et al., 2011, p. 492)“The influence of crystallinity on the various features of the tensile stressstrain response is considered over a large strain range, implying thermoplastic-like to elastomer-like mechanical behaviour.” (Ayoub et al., 2011, p. 492)“A physically-based hyperelastic–viscoplastic approach was adopted to develop a pertinent model for describing the mechanical behaviour of PE materials under finite strains. The semicrystalline polymer is being treated as a heterogeneous medium, and the model is based on a two-phase representation of the microstructure. The effective contribution of the crystalline and amorphous phases to the overall intermolecular resistance to deformation is treated in a composite framework, and coupled to a molecular network resistance to stretching and chain orientation capturing the overall strain hardening response.” (Ayoub et al., 2011, p. 492)“Comparisons between the constitutive model and experiments show fair agreement over a wide range of crystallinities (from 15\% to 72\%) and strain rates.” (Ayoub et al., 2011, p. 492)“The constitutive model is found to successfully capture the important features of the observed monotonic stress–strain response: the thermoplastic-like behaviour for high crystallinity includes a stiff initial response, a yield-like event followed by a gradual increase of strain hardening at very large strains; for the elastomer-like behaviour observed in the low crystallinity material, the strain hardening response is largely predominant. Strain recovery upon unloading increases with decreasing crystallinity: this is quantitatively well reproduced for high crystallinity materials, whereas predictions significantly deviate from experiments at low crystallinity.” (Ayoub et al., 2011, p. 492)“The use of semicrystalline polymers is steadily increasing owing to their potential to fulfill requirements for a large number of structural applications ranging from automotive/aeronautic to medical sectors.” (Ayoub et al., 2011, p. 493)“Their mechanical behaviour is highly nonlinear and sensitive to several external parameters (such as temperature, strain rate and triaxiality) and structural factors (including crystallinity index, crystal size and distribution in the structure, molecular weight, physical entanglement and cross-linking).” (Ayoub et al., 2011, p. 493)“Disregarding processing-induced effects, stiffness and yield resistance are mainly governed by the crystallinity index spanning from about 70\% down to a few percent only” (Ayoub et al., 2011, p. 493)“Starting from the work of Boyce et al. (2000), in which the elementary deformation mechanisms are described by two parallel resistances, Ahzi et al. (2003) (see also Makradi et al., 2005) and latter Ayoub et al. (2010) proposed rheological models for semicrystalline polymers. One resistance accounts for intermolecular interactions and the other deals with molecular network stretching and orientation process. The intermolecular resistance arises from a combination of amorphous and crystalline stiffness and flow. In such an approach, the crystal content is explicitly introduced in the model formulation.” (Ayoub et al., 2011, p. 493)“In the model proposed by Ahzi et al. (2003), the intermolecular amorphous and crystalline resistances are described according to the Arrhenius type expression proposed by Argon (1973) and later modified by Boyce et al. (2000).” (Ayoub et al., 2011, p. 493)“In order to improve the modelling capabilities during unloading process at small or moderate strains, Ayoub et al. (2010) proposed to directly incorporate the nonlinear viscosity effects on the elastic part by adopting the approach used by Colak (2005) in the overstress concept. In both cases, the network stress is described according to a visco-hyperelastic version of the eight-chain model of Arruda and Boyce (1993).” (Ayoub et al., 2011, p. 493)“The physically-based constitutive model proposed by Ahzi et al. (2003) was slightly modified in order to correctly describe the mechanical behaviour of PE materials.” (Ayoub et al., 2011, p. 493)},

	abstract = {In theories of the overall mechanical behaviour of polycrystals, composites, or other heterogeneous media, the transition from microscopic to macroscopic levels depends on finding connexions between suitably defined macro-variables and volume averages of microfields over a representative sample. Some connexions are established here for unrestricted deformation and internal rotations, w ithout regard to constitutive properties. General measures of stress and finite strain are considered, together w ith objective fluxes of stress. The comparative advantages of such variables are assessed, more especially in relation to the averaging of tensor products. A bilinear differential form, akin to Poincare’s integral invariant in Hamiltonian dynamics, plays an im portant role in the analysis.},

The general theory presented embodies the non-linear generalization of Voigt, Maxwell and other classes of viscoelastic solids and fluids. The fundamental equations for the thermoelastic solid, the thermoviscous fluid and other special classes of materials are obtained from the general theory by specialization. The theory is applied to the problem of rectilinear laminar flow between two heat reservoirs for three special classes of thermo-viscoelastic materials. Some results of matrix algebra pertinent to the development of the theory are presented in the appendix.},

	abstract = {The aim of this study is to understand the mechanism governing the transition strain rate of the elastic modulus in semi-crystalline polymer by coarse molecular dynamics (MD). In addition, the effects of the material properties such as molecular weight, crystallinity and lamella thickness on the elastic modulus are studied at various strain rates. The tensile deformation in the crystal direction at the various strain rates is simulated in the lamella MD model. As the results, the strong strain-rate dependency of the elastic modulus becomes prominent when the strain rate is larger than the structural relaxation rate. In addition, the crystallinity is the largest influencing factor on the elastic modulus, compared to the molecular weight and the lamella thickness. The transition strain rate of the elastic modulus gets smaller as the crystallinity increases. This means that the strong strain-rate dependency appears when the strain rate is larger than the relaxation rate of the amorphous phase. This is because the local strain rate of the amorphous phase is larger than that of the macroscopic strain rate.},

Holzapfel Graz University of Technology, Austria With a modern, comprehensive approach directed towards computational mechanics, this book covers a unique combination of subjects at present unavailable in any other text. It includes vital information on 'variational principles' constituting the cornerstone of the finite element method. In fact this is the only method by which Nonlinear Solid Mechanics is utilized in engineering practice. The book opens with a fundamental chapter on vectors and tensors. The following chapters are based on nonlinear continuum mechanics - an inevitable prerequisite for computational mechanicians. In addition, continuum field theory (applied to a representative sample of hyperelastic materials currently used in nonlinear computations such as incompressible and compressible materials) is presented, as are transversely isotropic materials, composite materials, viscoelastic materials and hyperelastic materials with isotropic damage. Another central chapter is devoted to the thermodynamics of materials, covering both finite thermoelasticity and finite thermoviscoelasticity. Also included are:* an up-to-date list of almost 300 references and a comprehensive index* useful examples and exercises for the student* selected topics of statistical and continuum thermodynamics.Furthermore, the principle of virtual work (in both the material and spatial descriptions) is compared with two and three-field variational principles particularly designed to capture kinematic constraints such as incompressibility. All of the features combined result in an essential text for final year undergraduates, postgraduates and researchers in mechanical, civil and aerospace engineering and applied maths and physics.},

To characterise continuous media in the context of thermodynamics, in general, one needs two material functions, in particular, a thermodynamic potential that defines all thermodynamic properties of the system and a constitutive law for the heat flux vector. (Note that the material constitutive behavior describes how the material reacts to deformation, wheres the constitutive equation for the heat flux describes how heat transfer is performed within the body).
The thermodynamic potential is a function from which we may derive state variables characterising the thermodynamic state of a system.
One of the most common and useful thermodynamic potentials is the so-called Helmohltz free energy. The application of this approach to the Clausis-Planck inequality allows obtaining direct expressions for the stress and entropy. For isothermal processes, the free-energy can also be associated with the internal strain energy functions, and as the status of the potential for stress.
It should be remembered that one needs to proceed with some thermodynamic potential to fully characterise the system. For instance, by choosing the Helmohltz free-energy, one can obtain the First Piola-Kirchhoff by derivative relative to the deformation gradient and the entropy by differentiation relative to the temperature. In contrast, if the internal energy is chosen instead, the First Piola-Kirchhoff is obtained by deriving relative to teh deformation gradient at constant entropy, while the temperature is obtained by deriving relative to the entropy at constant deformation.
The specific heat at constant deformation can be obtained by deriving the internal energy relative to temperature at fixed deformation, or equal to the symmetric of the second order derivative of the Helmohltz free-energy multiplier by the absolute temperature.
Depending on the dependent variables used to describe the constitutive behavior of the material, namely, a measure of deformation (F or C) alongside a non-mechanical variable (T or s), it is possible to define the isothermal and isentropic material tangent modulus. These are relevant for the definition of the problem splitting strategy employed in partitioned/staggered numerical solution approaches. While the isothermal approach is conditionally stable, the isentropic split has been shown to retain uncondition stability,

	abstract = {This paper presents a comparison of various models for strain‐softening due to damage such as cracking or void growth, as proposed recently in the literature. Continuum‐based models expressed in terms of softening stress—strain relations, and fracture‐type models expressed in terms of softening stress—displacement relations are distinguished. From one‐dimensional wave propagation calculations, it is shown that strain‐localization into regions of finite size cannot be achieved. The previously well‐documented spurious convergence is obtained with continuum models, while stress—displacement relations cannot model well smeared‐crack situations. Continuum models may, however, be used in general if a localization limiter is implemented. Gradient‐type localization limiters appear to be rather complicated; they require solving higher‐order differential equations of equilibrium with additional bourdary conditions. Non‐local localization limiters, especially the non‐local continuum with local strain, in which only the energy dissipating variables are non‐local, is found to be very effective, and also seems to be physically realistic. This formulation can correctly model the transition between homogeneous damage states and situations in which damage localizes into small regions that can be viewed as cracks. The size effect observed in the experimental and numerical response of specimens in tension or compression is shown to be a consequence of this progressive transition from continuum‐type to fracture‐type formulations.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            The strong influence of relatively small amounts of filler particles, such as carbon black, on the mechanical properties of elastomers has been well known for decades and has significantly contributed to increased use of elastomeric materials in many commercial applications. Even though the use of fillers is ubiquitous, satisfactory understanding and modeling of the micromechanisms by which fillers alter the mechanical behavior of elastomers has still not been realized. In this work the influence of filler particles on the equilibrium stress-strain response has been investigated. First, an experimental investigation probing the behavior of a chloroprene rubber with varied filler content has been performed. The experimental data allowed for a direct evaluation of both a newly developed constitutive model based on the amplification of the first strain invariant, and a number of other models proposed in the literature. A direct comparison with experimental data suggest that the new model generates superior predictions, particularly for large strain deformations. Then, in an effort to examine some of the assumptions that are common in the constitutive modeling and also to try to determine which of the input parameters are most important, a detailed series of micromechanical models were constructed using two- and three-dimensional finite element simulations. The results indicate that the effect of filler particles on the equilibrium behavior of elastomers can be accurately predicted using stochastic three-dimensional simulations suggesting that successful modeling mainly requires a rigorous treatment of the composite nature of the microstructure and not molecular level concepts such as alteration of mobility or effective crosslinking density in the elastomeric phase of the material.},

The development of constitutive equations which can describe the evolution of the mechanical memory of semicrystalline polymers and their insertion in a computer code employing the finite element method are preferential means for improving structural design.},

	abstract = {The Hamiltonian Bracket Formulation combined with the Avrami equation was used to develop a model for the flow-induced crystallization of polymers. The amorphous part of the chain was modeled as a non-linear Hookean dumbbell and the crystalline part as a rigid rod. Evolution equations for the configuration tensors of the two phases and for the degree of crystallinity were obtained and were subsequently solved for the transient and cessation case under different flow conditions. The model has a number of parameters that can be obtained (with the exception of one) from Theological measurements and quiescent crystallization experiments. The model predicts the variation in the degree of crystallinity and the induction time as a function of the polymer properties and the processing conditions. The model can also be used to predict the development of birefringence. The predictions of the model are in general agreement with the experimental observations.},

The need for rigorous consideration of both theoretical and algorithmic issues is emphasized, particularly in relation to the computational treatment of ﬁnite-strain elasto-plastic (viscoplastic) deformation, the modelling of frictional contact conditions and element technology capable of dealing with material incompressibility. Practically important aspects such as adaptive mesh reﬁnement procedures are discussed and attention is given to choice of appropriate error estimators for elasto-plastic materials and the transfer of solution parameters between successive meshes. The role of explicit solution techniques in the simulation of large-scale nonlinear problems is also discussed. The concept of discrete elements is brieﬂy described and their applications to a wide range of solid mechanics problems illustrated. Some advances in the ﬁeld of iterative equation solution methods are reviewed and their potential advantages in the simulation of large-scale nonlinear solid mechanics problems are demonstrated.},

	abstract = {Abstract The temperature, strain-rate, and pressure dependences of the yield stress have been determined for two polyethylene homopolymers of differing molecular weights and for a polyethylene copolymer. Samples were prepared by slowly cooling from the melt, and also by quenching in order to assess the effects of morphology on the yield behavior. The data have been analyzed on the basis of two Eyring processes acting in parallel. Comparison of all data sets reveals the existence in general of three distinct activated processes each with its own temperature, strain-rate, and pressure dependences. The relative contribution of each process is dependent on the molecular weight, morphology, etc. Also discussed is the relation of these three yield processes to the well-known loss processes of linear viscoelasticity.},

Therefore many attempts were carried out to find quantitative, or at least qualitative, models of non-linear behavior. The general or perhaps most attractive way of developing rheological constitutive equations consists in the search for the most general method to describe everything in the framework of a single approach. Naturally, this leads to very complicated and ambiguous equations. Meanwhile, it is reasonable to try another way based on separating observed phenomena into different types depending on observed phenomena into different types depending on their physical origin.

In a formal rational development of the subject, one first tries to state precisely what mathematical entities represent these physical concepts: a body is regarded to be a smooth manifold whose elements are the material points; a configuration is defined as a mapping of the body into a three-dimensional Euclidean space, and a force system is defined to be a vector-valued function defined for pairs of bodies1. Once these concepts are made precise one can proceed to the statement of general principles, such as the principle of objectivity or the law of balance of linear momentum, and to the statement of specific constitutive assumptions, such as the assertion that a force system can be resolved into body forces with a mass density and contact forces with a surface density, or the assertion that the contact forces at a material point depend on certain local properties of the configuration at the point. While the general principles are the same for all work in classical continuum mechanics, the constitutive assumptions vary with the application in mind and serve to define the material under consideration.},

It represents an extension of the class of generalized standard materials to higher order and higher grade continuum theories. It reconciles most existing frameworks and proposes some new extensions for micromorphic and strain gradient media. The special case of strain gradient plasticity is also included as a contribution to the current debate on the consideration of energetic and dissipative mechanisms. Finally, the stress gradient continuum theory emerges as a new research field for which an elastic-viscoplastic theory at finite deformations is provided for the first time.

	abstract = {There are a number of interesting applications where modeling elastic and/or viscoelastic materials is fundamental, including uses in civil engineering, the food industry, land mine detection and ultrasonic imaging. Here we provide an overview of the subject for both elastic and viscoelastic materials in order to understand the behavior of these materials. We begin with a brief introduction of some basic terminology and relationships in continuum mechanics, and a review of equations of motion in a continuum in both Lagrangian and Eulerian forms. To complete the set of equations, we then proceed to present and discuss a number of speciﬁc forms for the constitutive relationships between stress and strain proposed in the literature for both elastic and viscoelastic materials. In addition, we discuss some applications for these constitutive equations. Finally, we give a computational example describing the motion of soil experiencing dynamic loading by incorporating a speciﬁc form of constitutive equation into the equation of motion.},

Examples related to isothermal solid mechanics in the frame of small perturbation theory, including viscoplasticity and damge of ductile materials, are given. Global variables are introduced in an example from fracture mechanics. Homogenization and thermodynamics are also considered, providing some insight into the consistency of the l.a.s. model and into its physical interpretation.},

	abstract = {Transient tests are used to demonstrate unusual or even paradoxical deformation behaviors in metallic alloys and polymers at ambient and elevated temperatures. Included are repeated relaxation tests and creep tests of short duration. It is shown that creep rate need not increase with a stress increase and that, at the same stress level, creep rate can be different on loading and unloading. Also, a stress magnitude increase can be found during relaxation. Once steady inelastic flow is reached, the relaxation rate is nearly independent of the stress and strain at which relaxation starts; it depends mainly on the preceding prior inelastic strain rate. These phenomena can be modeled using an overstress (effective stress) dependence of inelastic rate of deformation and a proper evolution law for a single state variable, the equilibrium stress (back stress) within the context of a “unified” state variable theory. The author and his students have developed the viscoplasticity theory based on overstress (VBO) that can model these unusual behaviors.},

	abstract = {This is not a review article. It does not summarize our current understanding in the literature of the many different phenomena associated with nonuniform deformation and unstable flow. It does not emphasize the most pressing current problems or arguments. And most of all, it makes only scant reference to available experimental evidence, though suggestions for needed measurements are occasionally made. This article is an attempt to answer the question, what material characteristics determine which of the various kinds of nonuniform or unstable deformation are observed, and how rapidly do they develop. It is an exposition of a scheme to evaluate and represent relevant material properties, and it lays the groundwork for a prediction of macroscopic behavior under various boundary conditions. The review presented is a personal one, which has not as yet had the benefit of sufficient wide-spread scrutiny. While many of its component parts are rephrased versions of results absorbed from the literature, there are some novel suggestions.},

	abstract = {Le polyamide 11 (Pa11) est un polymère semicristallin à chaines linéaires très utilisé dans le domaine des hydrocarbures. Cette étude fournit une description de la déformation structurale d'éprouvettes de PA11 moulées par compression lors d'une déformation uniaxiale avant striction et en dessous de la température de transition vitreuse. La littérature, peu nombreuse, dénote une grande disparité dans la description du polymorphisme du PA11. La morphologie semicristalline de ce polymère solide issu de l'état fondu est de type sphérolitique. Les techniques utilisées ici pour caractériser la microstructure des échantillons sont la diffusion centrale des rayons X (DCRX) et la diffusion des rayons X aux grands angles (DRX) permettant de décrire la microstructure, respectivement, à l'échelle des lamelles et à l'échelle des différentes structures macromoléculaires. Une étude DRX des éprouvettes soumises a différents traitements thermiques a mis en évidence la présence de trois types de structures macromoléculaires : cristalline (phase [alpha], 20\% en volume en première approximation), amorphe (60\%) et smectique (phase [delta]', 20\%). Les éprouvettes sont maintenues en déformation pendant les mesures de diffusion des rayons X. L'étude des paramètres descriptifs des pics de diffusion a montré que les lamelles s'orientent faiblement dans la direction de traction, de même que les segments de chaine des phases amorphe et smectique, ce qui permet de supposer que la phase smectique est incluse dans la phase amorphe. A contrario, les segments de chaine de la phase cristalline, constituant les lamelles, s'orientent de façon très marquée perpendiculairement à la direction de traction. La comparaison des résultats issus des deux échelles différentes a permis de proposer l'activation d'un mécanisme de maclage au sein des lamelles orientées parallèlement à la direction de traction},

The polymer deformation is described by an improved macromolecular constitutive model accounting for strain-rate-, pressure-, and temperature-sensitive yielding, isotropic hardening before peak yield, intrinsic postyield softening, and rapid anisotropic hardening at large strains. A new craze model that accounts for craze initiation, growth, and breakdown mechanisms is employed. An energy-based criterion is used for cavitation induced cracking that can lead to fiber/matrix debonding. The role of voids is clarified by conducting a comparative study of unit cells with and without voids. The effects of strain rate and temperature are investigated by a parametric study. The overall composite stress-strain response is also depicted to indicate manifestation of microlevel failure on macroscopic behavior.},

  abstract = {A large deformation viscoplastic polycrystal theory is formulated. It is restricted to loading conditions since elasticity is entirely neglected. The single crystal behavior is based on crystallographic slip, and the slip rate is a non-linear function of the resolved shear stress. The time independent plasticity is obtained as a limit when the rate sensitivity tends to zero. The polycrystal behavior is obtained from the single crystal constitutive relation by solving integral equations derived from the field equations. A self-consistent approach is developed, where each grain is assumed to be a single ellipsoidal inclusion in a homogeneous equivalent medium. An interaction formula is derived and the local strain rates are calculated by resolving a nonlinear system of equations. Applications to texture predictions in tension, compression, rolling and torsion are finally considered. R\'esum\'e Nous formulons une th\'eorie des polycristaux viscoplastiques \`a forte d\'eformation, limit\'ee aux conditions de charge car on n\'eglige enti\`erement le domaine k\'elastique. Le comportement du monocristal est bas\'e sur le glissement cristallographique, et la vitesse de glissement est une fonction non lin\'eaire de la contrainte de cisaillement r\'eduite. La limite obtenue lorsque la sensibilit\'e \`a la vitesse tend vers z\'ero, constitue la plasticit\'e ind\'ependante du temps. On obtient le comportement du polycristal \`a partir de la relation de base du monocristal en r\'esolvant les \'equations int\'egrales d\'eriv\'ees des \'equations de champ. Nous d\'eveloppons une approche autocoh\'erente o\`u l'on assimile chaque grain \`a une inclusion ellipso\"idale unique dans un milieu homog\`ene \'equivalent. Nous en d\'eduisons une formule d'interaction et nous calculons les vitesses de d\'eformation locales en r\'esolvant un syst\`eme non lin\'eaire d'\'equations. Nous consid\'erons enfin les applications de cette approche \`a la pr\'evision des textures en tension, en compression, en laminage et en torsion. Zusammenfassung Es wird eine Theorie f\"ur das viskoplastische Verhalten von Polykristallen bei gro{$\beta$}en Verformungen vorgelegt. Diese Theorie ist auf Lastbedingungen beschr\"ankt, da die Elastizit\"at vollst\"angig vernachl\"assigt wird. Das Einkristallverhalten basiert auf kristallografischer Gleitung, die Gleitgeschwin-digkeitist eine nichtlineare Funktion der Flie{$\beta$}spannung. Das von der Zeit unabh\"angige plastische Verhalten ergibt sich, wenn die Geschwindigkeitsempfindlichkeit zu Null wird. Das Verhalten des Polykristalles ergibt sich aus den Einkristallbeziehungen, indem die aus den Feldgleichungen abgeleiteten Integralgleichungen gel\"ost werden. Eine selbst-konsistente N\"aherung wird entwickelt, bei dem jedes einzelne Korn als ein ellipsoidf\"ormiger Einschlu{$\beta$} in einem homogenen \"aquivalentmedium angesehen wird. Eine Wechselwirkungsformel wird hergeleitet und die lokalen Verformungsraten werden durch L\"osung eines nichtlinearen Gleichungssystems berechnet. Schlie{$\beta$}lich werden Anwendungen betrachtet, mit denen durch Zug, Druck, Wolzen und Torsion erzeugte Texturen vorausgesagt werden k\"onnen.},

  abstract = {The finite deformation response of an epoxy resin is investigated in the glassy regime using a constitutive relation that accounts for thermally activated yielding, pressure-sensitivity, strain softening and molecular chain reorientation. A previous formulation of this macromolecular model is modified so as to decouple the onset of yielding from the peak nominal stress, and enable accurate modeling of temperature and strain-rate effects concurrently. The latter cannot be modeled adequately with existing models when the temperature dependence of elastic moduli is accounted for. Tension and compression experiments are carried out on Epon 862 across a range of temperatures and strain rates. Special care is taken to extract the intrinsic material behavior from the recorded mechanical responses using a new technique of video-based extensometry, which is well adapted to cylindrical geometries. Key features of the data include a temperature dependence of elastic moduli and a tension\textendash compression asymmetry that goes beyond differences in peak yield. The experimental data is divided in two sets for model calibration and assessment. The first set contains sufficient data to identify all model parameters following a procedure outlined in the paper. The second data set is used to assess the predictive capabilities of the model for test conditions not used in the calibration step. It is shown that when the tension and compression cases are treated separately, with respect to post-peak softening, model predictions are excellent over the investigated ranges of temperature and strain rate.},

The theory, therefore, is independent of a yield criterion or loading and unloading conditions. The deformation rate components are determinable from the current state which permits an incremental formulation of problems. Strain hardening is considered in the equations by introducing plastic work as the representative state variable. The problem of tensile straining has been examined for a number of histories that included straining at various rates, rapid changes of strain rate, unloading and reloading, and stress relaxation. The calculations were based on material constants chosen to represent commercially pure titanium. The results are in good agreement with corresponding experiments on titanium specimens.},

	abstract = {Morphological studies of plastic deformation of single crystals, thin layers, and bulk samples together with mechanical, X-ray and infra-red data revealed the existence of three stages in cold drawing of crystalline polymer: the plastic deformation of the original spherulitic structure, the discontinuous transformation of the spherulitic into fibre structure by micronecking, and the plastic deformation of the fibre structure. The initial material, which has low strength and high ductility, consist of stacks of parallel lamellae with few interlamella links. It deforms plastically by stack rotation, sliding of lamellae, phase change and twinning of crystal lattice, chain slip and tilt until the predeformed lamellae reach the position of maximum compliance for fracture by micronecking. The micronecks transform every single lamella into microfibrils of between one and three hundred angstroms in width, consisting of folded chain blocks broken off the lamella primarily by chain slip in the boundary layers between adjacent mosaic blocks. The chains bridging the crack are partially unfolded during the micronecking process. They connect in axial direction the blocks in the microfibril as intrafibrillar tie molecules. The number of microfibrils per cm of crack length increases with molecular weight. The draw ratio of the microfibrils and the axial separation in the microfibril of the originally adjacent crystal blocks increase with the average distance between microfibrils and, hence, decrease with increasing molecular weight. The concentration of micronecks in every stack of lamellae in a thin destruction zone produces a bundle of microfibrils of rather uniform draw ratio. Such a fibril measuring a few thousand angstroms in width includes the interlamella ties of the original sample as interfibrillar tie molecules connecting adjacent microfibrils. The concentration of micronecks also provides the conditions for a nearly adiabatic heating of the generated fibril by the transformation work in the destruction zone. The local temperature rise imparts so much mobility to the chains in the crystal blocks that during subsequent cooling to ambient temperature, the long period becomes adjusted to this temperature. The more or less random distribution of destruction zones in the neck makes the transformation from spherulitic to fibre structure appear to be a gradual process in spite of the discontinuous transformation in the micronecks. The plastic deformation of the new fibre structure can proceed only by longitudinal sliding of microfibrils past each other, a process limited by interfibrillar tie molecules. Hence, high molecular weight samples with many interlamella links exhibit a smaller draw ratio than lower molecular weight material. The three stages are to some extent intermixed in the neck. In the initial neck characterised by a low draw ratio and rather gentle constriction, the transformation into the fibre structure is not complete, so that some of the remains of the original microspherulitic structure are still present in the necked portion. They are destroyed during subsequent drawing which completes the transformation and also deforms the fibre structure. The sharply constricted mature neck, however, yields a high draw ratio which is composed of the draw ratio of microfibrils and of subsequent sliding motion of the microfibrils. The technically important natural draw ratio is the maximum draw ratio obtained with the sample under the conditions of the experiment. It seems to be higher than the draw ratio of the microfibrils.},

            Transient creep of many materials at high temperatures obeys Andrade's law, in which creep strain is proportional to the cube root of time. The present paper aims at revisiting in terms of criticality the different explanations proposed so far. In agreement with Mott's statistical theory, and using the concept of load shedding and mechanical cascades introduced in Cottrell's microscopic model, we show that Andrade creep is obtained assuming only long range back stresses and delayed obstacle overcoming, both of them involving a large number of interacting sites responsible for stress fluctuations. The time exponent is 1/3 if work hardening is linear, and larger otherwise. Andrade's creep appears as a power law approach of the linear (or χ) creep regime.},

	abstract = {Plastic flow behavior of low carbon steel has been studied at room temperature during tensile deformation by varying the initial strain rate of 3.3 ×10-4 s-1 to the final strain rate ranging from 1.33×10-3 s-1 to 2.0×10-3 s-1 at a fixed engineering strain of 12\%. Haasen plot revealed that the mobile dislocation density remained almost invariant at the juncture where there was a sudden increase in stress with the change in strain rate and the plastic flow was solely dependent on the velocity of mobile dislocations. In that critical regime, the variation of stress with time was fitted with a Boltzman type Sigmoid function. The increase in stress was found to increase with final strain rate and the time elapsed to attain these stress values showed a decreasing trend. Both of these parameters saturated asymptotically at higher final strain rate.},

	abstract = {Transients in creep are of fundamental importance. They are commonly described either by a change in the isotropic strength of a material due to an increase in dislocation density or by a change in directional hardening, often described by a backstress. Here we look at transients as developed by load redistribution in Finite Element simulations. Two types of material models are used. The first contains grains with binary strength; the other uses grains with a continuous distribution of strengths. It was found that the load redistribution process is an important source in transient yielding and creep. An equivalent stress quantity to track the strength of a sample during deformation is proposed. Using this quantity a single load shedding curve can be obtained for both the tensile and creep tests. This unifies the material constitutive behavior for the very different boundary conditions seen in creep and constant-rate testing.},

The chemical structure of PTFE, -(C2F4)-n, makes it ideally suited for investigation by neutron methods as it is free of hydrogen that results in limited penetration depths and poor diffraction acquisition in most polymers. Deformation parallel to the prismatic plane normals is shown to occur by inter-polymer chain compression with a modulus ∼10× bulk, while deformation parallel to the basal plane normal occurs by intra-polymer chain compression with a modulus ∼1000× bulk, corresponding with theoretical values for a PTFE chain modulus.

Anisotropic effects are characterized through tensile tests using several complex loading paths involving large deformation, and for different orientation with respect to the extrusion direction. A mechanical model is then developed, based on a non-equilibrium thermodynamic approach of irreversible processes, resulting in a new thermodynamic potential describing both the elasto-viscoelastic–viscoplastic behavior and the volume variation due to damage. Results show that transverse strains and volume strain of HDPE highly depend on specimen orientation, whereas the apparent Young's modulus is not affected by this orientation.

The geometry and dimensions of the specimens were determined after a critical evaluation of the test conditions, so as to avoid plastic buckling of the specimens, and to minimize undesirable stresses at the specimen ends. Using the present technique, it was possible to conduct tests at room temperature up to strains of 200\% for polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) and 1000\% for polyethylene, without extensive crazing. Optimum precision and homogeneity of strains within the samples could be achieved because of firm guiding of the gripped specimen heads during the tests. A systematic study of the influence of shear strain rate and temperature on the plastic behaviour was made particularly for the polyethylene samples. The kinematics of large deformation simple shear is discussed and relations between the stress and the finite-strain tensors is presented, with particular attention being paid to the development of normal stresses. The problem of end effects is also investigated. Finally, it is shown that the strain hardening of polyethylene under simple shear is much smaller than under uniaxial tension. A possible interpretation of this behaviour is proposed in terms of the uniqueness versus multiplicity of slip systems.},

A second ductile-to-brittle transition was observed at low strain rates with decreasing strain rate. The yield stress showed a region of low, relatively constant, rate dependence at low strain rates, high temperatures and low pressures and a second region of higher strain-rate dependence at high strain rates and pressures. In contrast, the fracture stress was found throughout to have a relatively constant strain-rate dependence of intermediate value between those obtained for the yield stress. These features confirmed that failure can be considered as competition between yield and fracture processes. The fracture stress became lower than the yield stress at both high and low strain rates where brittle fracture was observed, with fully ductile behaviour resulting in intermediate conditions where the fracture stress exceeded the yield stress. The pressure, strain rate and temperature dependence of the yield stress was well described by two Eyring processes acting in parallel, both processes being pressure dependent.},

  abstract = {The constitutive behaviour of amorphous polymers near the glass transition contains many features general to this class of materials. A new, physically based, three-dimensional constitutive model has been developed for simulating this wide range of features in models of polymer products and processes. In particular, the model displays glassy response at low temperatures and short time-scales, and rubber-like response at high temperatures and long time-scales, and is therefore an example of a glass-rubber constitutive model. Its basis is the assumed additivity of free energies of bond distortion and conformation perturbation. For the elastic bond distortion stress-strain law and flow model, and the conformational entropy function, the model employs linear elasticity, Eyring viscous flow and the Edwards-Vilgis entropy function, respectively. Glass structure and temperature dependence are introduced through the Vogel-Tammann-Fulcher and Arrhenius equations for viscosity, respectively. With parameters obtained for poly(ethylene terephthalate) in a companion paper, the model was solved numerically to simulate a variety of uniaxial strain sequences, and found to replicate well the characteristic patterns of behaviour of amorphous polymers in the temperature region of interest, over a wide range of experimental situations from small to large strains. The only major deficiency, resulting from the simplifying assumption of a single activation barrier height, is its being too localized in the time domain. At high temperatures and long times, applicability of the model is limited by the onset of conformational relaxation.},

Whereas the viscoelastic strain rates are assumed to be derivable from the appropriate creep integral laws of classical viscoelasticity, the plastic strain rates in stress space are dependent not only on the path history but also the time history of stress. After postulating the existence of a regular loading surface in the viscoelastic-plastic state and deducing the appropriate criterion for loading, a major portion of the paper is devoted to establishing (a) the convexity of the loading surface, (b) the direction of the plastic strain-rate vector in stress space, and (c) the structure of the constitutive equations for the plastic strain rates. The loading surface of the present theory (in contrast to that of the inviscid theory of plasticity), being dependent on certain measures representing time history of stress, is allowed to change its shape continually; this has implications in the interpretation of experimental results dealing with the determination of the initial and subsequent yield surfaces where corners are observed.},

The interrelationship between activation area or activation volume and effective stress has been employed in the present model, rather than the applied stress dependency on these thermodynamic quantities. The model predicted the decrease in obstacle spacing and the increase in internal stress with nitrogen at all the applied stress levels. Across the nitrogen content, the evaluated activation volume ranging from 400 to 900 b3 suggested the dominance of forest dislocation intersections coupled with the non-conservative motion of jogged dislocations during steady-state creep. The rate constant parameter of the model associated with the dynamic recovery exhibited a decreasing trend with nitrogen. The variations in the strength enhanced activation volume and length of the dislocation segment against the applied stress/yield strength exhibited the unified power law relationships, irrespective of nitrogen content. The model appropriately predicted the creep strain/rate vs. time curves and steady-state creep rate vs. internal stress and effective stress quantities. By incorporating the damage term into the creep rate equation, the developed model is extended for the prediction of entire creep strain-time curves.
In the present study, sine hyperbolic creep rate law coupled with the evolution of internal stress with time has been employed for modelling transient and steady state creep deformation behaviours of type 316LN austenitic stainless steel (SS). The model predicts the creep strain-time and creep rate-time data appropriately for the stress levels ranging from 120 to 225 MPa at 923 K, with good agreement between experimental and predicted steady state creep rates. At all the stress levels, the predicted internal stress increases with time during transient creep, and it approaches saturation at steady state creep. The predicted increase in internal stress was interrelated to the increase in dislocation density and a decrease in the mean free path during creep deformation. At steady state condition, a decrease in activation volume with an increase in applied stress levels has been observed for the steel. The estimated value of activation volume for the steel demonstrates the dominance of intersection of forest dislocations and non-conservative motion of jogs during transient creep in type 316LN SS. The applicability of the present model has been demonstrated towards the prediction of stress-relaxation behaviour of type 316LN SS based on the power law interrelation between internal stress and applied stress.
Creep deformation of an advanced high-strength, creep-resistant austenitic stainless steel Sanicro 25 was investigated experimentally at temperatures from 700 °C to 800 °C and stresses below 40 MPa. Results show that the creep behaviour is qualitatively similar as that of the other creep-resistant steels, having much weaker stress and temperature dependencies of the creep rate than those at higher stresses. Creep performance of the Sanicro 25 steel allows temperatures of at least 50 °C higher than the classical AISI-316 H austenitic steel, even at low stresses.
Creep experiments are time consuming and expensive; moreover, it is not possible to carry out experiments under the actual service conditions of particular materials due to the very low creep strain rate. However, the process seems to be an ideal field for computer modelling. The experimental data are obviously only available for steady-state conditions, and so the effects of varying conditions during startup or shutdown of the components can be described by modelling. Modelling creep deformation is usually based on the so-called “creep constitutive equations”, which describe the strain rate dependence on stress, temperature and time, or creep strain. Unfortunately, the equations are derived from conventional creep experiments under constant load conditions, and so the transient effects upon stress changes are ignored. Because the stress is transformed between model elements, a correct description of the creep behaviour must contain the transient effects. In this work, the conventional approach to describing primary and secondary creep stages is combined with an internal stress model of the transient creep stage to address the problem of the stress changes, as well as that of the low-stress creep regime.
To investigate creep mechanisms of Inconel718 and Allvac718Plus, creep behaviors of two alloys are studied under the temperature of 700 °C and three applied stresses (560 MPa, 650 MPa and 720 MPa) by using multiple microstructural analysis methods, including scanning electron microscope (SEM), emission scanning electron microscope (FSEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Result shows that steady-state region is not observed in these two alloys. Creep curves of two alloys are composed of primary region and tertiary region. Tertiary region occupies a dominant position. Ductile dimples are observed on creep fracture surface, indicating creep mechanisms of two alloys are the formation of creep voids. In this study, the formation of creep voids is found to be correlated with three factors which are dislocation multiplication, dislocation motion and dislocation obstacles. Inconel718 has higher dislocation multiplication rate, larger dislocation motion rate, more δ phases and less bands than Allvac718Plus. Therefore, Inconel718 has higher creep voids rate than Allvac718Plus, leading to the result that Inconel718 has shorter creep life than Allvac718Plus.
A mathematical model to predict creep properties of Ni-based superalloys at intermediate temperature ranges based on microstructure, process and creep condition, and material properties has been developed by modifying and combining previous models. Modifications are made so that as many necessary model parameters as possible, whose values have been obtained from experimental measurement of creep properties, are determined from CALPHAD (CALculation of PHAse Diagrams) thermodynamic calculations. The model can reproduce minimum creep rate, creep rupture time, and time to specific strain for a wide range of Ni-based superalloys, correlating well with experimental data without any further creep experiments. The applicability and limitation of the model as an alloy design tool for new Ni-based superalloys with improved creep properties are discussed in this paper.
The effect of Ag nanoparticles (NPs) on the optical properties of ZnO has been investigated. Samples of pure and Ag doped ZnO were synthesized by the combustion method. X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscope and UV–vis spectrophotometer measurements confirmed the growth of Ag NPs in the ZnO matrix. The near band edge (NBE) emission from ZnO excited by a 325 nm He-Cd laser was significantly enhanced in the presence of {\textasciitilde}5 nm diameter Ag NPs. The experimental results suggest that the origin of enhanced NBE emission is due to direct interaction between the laser photons and Ag NPs, which in turn leads to photoemission transfer of electrons from the Ag NPs to the conduction band of ZnO. This is different from previously reported mechanisms where the photoemission transfer of electrons was mediated by plasmon decay.
The electronic structures, magnetic properties and half-metallicity in Zr2IrZ (Z = Al, Ga, In) alloys with the Hg2CuTi-type structure were systematically investigated by using the first-principle calculations. Zr2IrZ (Z = Al, Ga, In) alloys are predicted to be half-metallic ferrimagnets which are quite robust against hydrostatic strain and tetragonal deformation. The total magnetic moment of Zr2IrZ (Z = Al, Ga, In) alloys mainly originates from the 4d electrons of Zr atoms and follows the conventional Slater-Pauling rule: Mt = Zt−18. (Mt is the total magnetic moment per unit cell and Zt is the valence concentration). The origin of the band gap for Zr2IrZ (Z = Al, Ga, In) alloys is also well studied. Unconventionally, Zr2Ir-based alloys contain element with 5d valence electrons, which implies a wider field to search for new half-metallic materials.
Samples from normalized and tempered modified 9Cr–1Mo steel, were normalized at three different temperatures and rolled at four different temperatures and subsequently tempered. Samples were then subjected to instrumented Charpy impact tests. Impact properties were represented in terms of upper shelf energy, ductile-to-brittle transition temperature, 28 J energy transition temperature, general yield temperature, blunt-notched dynamic fracture toughness (Kjd) and reference temperature. Kjd was determined following the modified Schindler’s procedure. Correlation between different transition temperatures and their conservativeness were analyzed in view of fracture safe design. Finally, microstructural parameters were related to the impact transition temperatures based on microstructural and fractographic studies.
We report the conventional and inverse barocaloric effect (BCE) in ferroelastics (NH4)3NbOF6 and (NH4)3TiOF5. We found a rich set of the structural phase transitions and triple points on the T − p phase diagrams. Extensive and intensive BCE near some transformations and around triple points in both crystals are outstanding ({\textbar}∆ SBCEmax {\textbar} = 30–100 J/kg·K; {\textbar}∆ TADmax {\textbar} = 4–22 K) and can be achieved at low pressure 0.01–0.60 GPa.

A new kind of magneto-mechanical effect of Ni-Mn-Ga microwire is explored by combining stress field-induced twist (SFIT) with magnetic field-induced twist (MFIT) under the condition of stress-magnetic coupling. It has been found that Ni-Mn-Ga shape memory microwire exhibits a large recoverable strain up to 12\%, superelastic strain of {\textasciitilde} 9\% with critical stress for martensitic transformation {\textasciitilde} 66 MPa. On the basis of excellent mechanical properties, a reversible SFIT angle of 5.2° for the total length (18 cm) of the microwire and a recoverable MFIT angle up to 1250″/cm have been achieved. By controlling the stress to make the microwire in different stages during martensitic transformation, the total MFIT angle (excluding SFIT angle) decreases slightly at the stage of austenite elastic deformation, then increases again during martensitic variant reorientation. The MFIT angle changes periodically as a function of the magnetic field magnitude and direction. The relationships between the MFIT angle and the static force, magnetic field, magnetic field torsional angle are summarized in this paper. The coupling coefficient k corresponding to the austenite and martensite is obtained. This phenomenon provides a new way to achieve large twist under the condition of stress-magnetic coupling for smart materials.
In this work we investigate the Orowan hypothesis, that decreases in surface energy due to surface adsorbates lead directly to lowered fracture toughness, at an atomic/molecular level. We employ a Lennard-Jones system with a slit crack and an infiltrating fluid, nominally with gold-water properties, and explore steric effects by varying the soft radius of fluid particles and the influence of surface energy/hydrophobicity via the solid–fluid binding energy. Using previously developed methods, we employ the J{\textless}math{\textgreater}{\textless}mrow is="true"{\textgreater}{\textless}mi is="true" mathvariant="bold"{\textgreater}J{\textless}/mi{\textgreater}{\textless}/mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}/math{\textgreater}-integral to quantify the sensitivity of fracture toughness to the influence of the fluid on the crack tip, and exploit dimensionless scaling to discover universal trends in behavior.},

	abstract = {This chapter discusses the progress in the field of plasticity of the diamond cubic structure (D.S.) from the standpoint of a micromechanical (dislocation dynamical) theory of macroscopic plastic properties. It is suggested that hat the high resistance to dislocation motion of D.S. crystals stems from a high Peierls potential. The problem is to understand the creation and movement of kinks as the elementary vehicles of dislocation motion. How do kinks interact with each other and with other lattice defects, including phonons? How does a distribution of kinks arise which shows up in the shape of dislocation lines frozen-in after deformation and observed in electron transmission? Semiconductor doping provides a unique possibility for manipulating the core structure of the dislocation in the D.S. and thus the Peierls potential. Its effect shows up microscopically in the dislocation dynamics as well as macroscopically in the deformation curves of D.S. crystals. The study of the charge on a dislocation in a doped semiconductor by measurement of its electrical properties discussed that may serve as a link in understanding the doping effects in dislocation dynamics.},

The thermo gravimetric analysis results indicated a three-stage degradation for the polytetrafluroethylene-filled composites.

It was found that the influence of polytetrafluroethylene filler on the static and dynamic coefficient of friction and specific wear rate of the composite was more pronounced at dry wear test condition and it was found as 0.22, 0.12, and 4.87484?E-09, respectively. However, the results of improved storage and loss modulus and damping manifested negative correlation with the friction characteristics in the glassy region. Further, the SEM-coupled EDX spectral analysis was performed to understand the formation of transfer layer in counter surface.

	abstract = {Measurements of the viscoelastic functions Δ, G', G″, J′, and J″ as functions of temperature from −180 to +180°C. have been obtained, using a torsion pendulum apparatus, for several samples of polychlorotrifluoroethylene having widely different crystallinities as determined by density. The low crystallinity samples show two relaxations: a very broad one (γ) centered at about −35°C. which appears to be split into two processes, and one (β) at 84°C. In the higher crystallinity samples, a third process (α) appears at about 137°C., and the high temperature side of the γ relaxation peak is lower in magnitude as compared to the lower crystallinity specimens. For the β peak, which is assumed to be associated with the glass transition, the peak value for G″ is essentially independent of crystallinity, while both Δ and J″ show decreases in magnitude with increasing crystallinity. The relationship between the magnitude of the relaxation peak and crystallinity, and dependence of this relationship upon the viscoelastic function chosen to characterize the relaxation are discussed.},

	abstract = {A torsion pendulum has been used to measure the internal friction of polytetrafluoroethylene. The crystallinity of the specimens varied form 48 to 92\%, and the measurements were made over a wide temperature range. The site of each relaxation was assigned by observing the variation of relaxation strength and peak height with crystallinity. In this way amorphous relaxations were found to occur at 176.5°K. (0.60 cycle/sec.) and 399°K. (0.62 cycle/sec.). The crystallite relaxations occur at 291°K. (0.28 cycle/sec.) and the crystallite melting point, 600°K. It is concluded that the amorphous regions of polytetrafluoroethylene exist in three phases between 4.2°K. and the crystallite melting point. The supercooled liquid which exists below 600°K. is transformed into an amorphous solid at a temperature in the region of 400°K. This solid undergoes another transformation at approximately 176°K. to form a third phase which is stable down to 4.2°K. The crystallite realaxation centered at 291°K. consists of a series of disordering transitions including the well-known first-order transition. There is evidence that hindered rotation occurs within the crystallites at temperatures as low as 220°K.},

	abstract = {Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) has been used for many years in different application fields due to its outstanding chemical and physical properties. But, the value of its glass transition temperature is still today a matter of controversy and very different values are proposed in the literature. This paper proposes to answer to this scientific question using dynamic mechanical measurements. First, the viscoelastic properties of PTFE are described on a large temperature range and the influence of the shearing frequency is carefully investigated. Then, the effects produced by the polymer annealing on its thermomechanical behavior are detailed. This study comforts the idea that PTFE amorphous phase should be considered as comprised of two distinct regions. The first one named “mobile amorphous fraction” (MAF) is able to relax at low temperature (T=−103°C). The other one is specific of the macromolecular segments present at the boundaries between crystalline and amorphous domains. Due to the close vicinity of the crystallites, these macromolecular segments present a more restricted mobility. The corresponding phase is designated as the “rigid amorphous fraction” (RAF) and its mechanical relaxation produces itself at higher temperature (T=116°C). Actually, this latter value is strongly dependent on the material crystallinity degree. In particular, it is shifted to higher temperature after occurrence of a recrystallization that is accompanied by a further reduction of the RAF’s dynamic. Instead, the characteristics of the MAF relaxation are poorly affected. Tensile tests also support that the “real” Tg of the polymer is located at low temperature. All these results have been compared to those of the literature to propose a real scientific discussion and to understand the origin of somewhat contradictory interpretations.},

The research showed that as a result of aging, the amount of the crystalline phase increases by about 8\%, which translates into the properties of the aged material. The glass transition and melt temperature of lamellar crystals formed during first and second crystallisation increase with aging. The mechanical properties of the material were analysed in the temperature range of 25 to 75 °C. The tests were showing an increase in Young’s modulus and a decrease in elongation at the break as a result of aging. This phenomenon was particularly visible during tests at 75 °C and during the morphological observation of the fracture surface, where the fracture character of the material changes from ductile to brittle. In the case of the material aged for the longest time, the temperature has a negligible influence on the elongation at break.},

The film of polyvinyl  (PVC) and that of nitrile-butadiene rubber (NBR) were used as materials of the model specimens. The results of measurements were compared with the values calculated from  properties of component polymers.Close agreement was obtained between the observed values of E' and E" of various types of model specimens and the values calculated by the equation, in which the volume fraction and  form were taken into .As  of the two phase system, Cycolac H of Marbon Chem. Co. was studied. Its temperature dispersion curve resembles  to that of model specimen, which was constructed by putting the rubber phase (NBR) into  phase (PVC). The location of the higher temperature dispersion of Cycolac H, 115°C, accorded with that of the dispersion of a styrene-acrylonitrile copolymer separately measured. The lower temperature dispersion at -185°C was found to correspond to that of polybutadiene. The dispersion curves of Cycolac H were successfully calculated by employing those of the component polymers based upon the two phase simple model.As an example of molecularly mixed system, the measurements were performed on the specimens prepared from PVC and NBR of various compositions by the solvent casting method with tetrahydrofuran. Of all the compositions, only one main absorption was found at the temperature region between the absorptions of PVC and NBR. The shape of absorption becomes most broad at the intermediate compositions. This broadness is considered to be due to the microheterogeneity in segmental size, corresponding to the varieties of segmental environment. The general expression for this case was presented.The shape of temperature dispersion curve for the partially miscible system showed an intermediate form between those of the typical two phase system and the molecularly mixed system. The behavior of blends of a styrene-acrylonitrile copolymer and NBR belongs to this type. Observed values for this system were compared with the values calculated on the basis of the typical two phase system of the same compositions. Definite deviations from calculated values were found, which were duly ascribed to the portion of molecularly mixed phase. Broadening of absorptions of both rubber and plastic phases could not be interpreted from the typical two phase model, but only from the consideration of the effect of molecularly mixing.This circumstances were ascertained by the behavior of the model specimen specifically prepared for this purpose.},

The temperature dependence of complex moduli of the crystalline polymers with various degrees of crystallinity is illustrated by using the model. On the basis of the model, we have derived an equation for calculating the strain-optical coefficient of the crystalline polymer from those of the crystalline and the non-crystalline phase. The equation gives a relation among the rheo-optical quantities, the viscoelastic quantities and the parameters representing the fine structure and the crystallinity of the polymer. It is concluded from this equation that the strain optical coefficients cannot be expressed by such a simple additive relation as usually employed.},

The method utilizes a computer-aided video extensometer which analyses the sample profile in real time. The effective strain is computed automatically from the minimum diameter, and the effective stress is deduced from the applied load by taking into account the stress triaxiality corresponding to the local radius of curvature of the sample profile. Furthermore, a digital closed-loop system controls the ram speed of the hydraulic tensile testing machine in such a way that the local effective strain rate is maintained at a constant value. It is shown that most polymeric and metallic materials are entitled to be investigated by this method, which gives access in real time to the constitutive plastic equation, up to strains far beyond the necking point. The capabilities of the technique are illustrated and discussed critically, with more details for two polymers of different structures: polyethylene and polycarbonate.},

  abstract = {The need to model fracture in crashworthiness by means of finite element codes is a real challenge for research. Before implementing fracture criteria, an excellent knowledge of the stress and strain states in the material just before the crack appearance is the first condition necessary to ensure the model development. At present, most of the material behaviour laws, for example for steel, are only defined until the maximum force when necking occurs. For polymers, the early occurrence of the diffuse necking leads to an experimental technique in which the speed loading is controlled in real time to maintain a constant strain rate during the test. This technique is not however used, due to technical limitations, for high strain rate behaviour laws. In this paper, the authors propose to use the heterogeneity of the displacement field on the surface of the tensile specimen as an initial condition to identify behaviour laws. The method developed uses the information in all the surface zone of the specimen by using digital image correlation. Stresses, strains and strain rates are then obtained to build a surface behaviour called the SE\.E surface. By cutting it, the experimental behaviour laws for a range of large strains and strain rates are then defined for model identification.},

  abstract = {Certain physical results from the study of dislocation motions lead to the concept of ideal viscoplasticity. In particular the existence of a limiting dislocation velocity, coupled with an upper limit on dislocation density, provides an upper bound on the dislocation flux. Thus, the plastic strain rate in polycrystalline metals must also be bounded in many cases of interest. This physical situation can be idealized by postulating transition functions from zero to maximum flux in as simple as possible a manner consistent with the problem under investigation and the solution features to be examined. A drastic transition function is given here which leads to multiaxial stress, strain, strain-rate relations of reasonable simplicity and these are illustrated by application to several example problems. A common feature of the solutions of the examples treated is that the material response is partly rate dependent and partly rate independent. This indicates that the corresponding physical situations are characterized by large dislocation fluxes during part of the time and very small fluxes at other times.},

	abstract = {Ce travail est une contribution à l'étude de la plasticité en traction uniaxiale des polyéthylènes entre la température de la transition vitreuse et la fusion cristalline. L'étude systématique de 3 copolymères d'éthylène/1-butène couvrant la plage de cristallinité [0. 65-0. 35] a permis d'élucider les mécanismes complexes de l'écoulement plastique par le biais de mesures de contrainte-déformation vraies couplées à une analyse structurale de la déformation. La formation de la striction s'accompagne d'un gradient de vitesse de déformation et développe des contraintes normales le long du profil de la striction. La propagation de l'instabilité plastique s'effectue à partir des régions concaves de l'épaule de striction ou les chaînes adoptent une orientation préférentielle oblique. Il apparaît en outre que le système de glissement préférentiel dans le polyéthylène sphérolitique est (010)[001]. L'orientation progressive de l'axe des chaînes dans la direction d'étirage est responsable du durcissement et conduit à la stabilisation de la striction. La plasticité des polyéthylènes est gouvernée par deux mécanismes de déformation plastique : l'un homogène, l'autre hétérogène. Le mécanisme homogène est un cisaillement des lamelles cristallines dans les plans (010). Il est caractérisé par une consolidation élevée et des paramètres d'activation thermique relativement faibles. Son amorçage est contrôlé par l'épaisseur des lamelles cristallines. Ce mécanisme est étroitement lié aux mobilités moléculaires mises en jeu dans la relaxation cristalline. Le mécanisme hétérogène correspond à un glissement localisé dans la lamelle cristalline. Il est caractérisé par une faible consolidation et dépend moins de la température et de la cristallinité que le précédent. Le caractère compétitif de ces deux mécanismes suggère qu'ils sont situés dans des régions distinctes des lamelles cristallines. Afin de rendre compte de ces observations, deux modèles théoriques ont été proposés sur des considérations structurales. Le modèle de génération thermique de dislocations à partir de la surface latérale des cristaux permet de décrire convenablement le mécanisme homogène. Le modèle de glissement aux interfaces défectueuses de la structure mosaïque prédit de façon satisfaisante l'évolution avec la température de la contrainte d'écoulement du mécanisme hétérogène.},

Les mecanismes de creation et de propagation de bandes de cisaillement intervenant dans la deformation de la phase amorphe du pa11 peuvent etre assimiles a ceux de propagation de dislocations dans les metaux. Cependant, le pa11 acquiert un comportement radicalement different de celui des metaux lorsqu'il est soumis a des conditions favorables aux mecanismes diffusionnels de deformation. Ainsi, toujours en dessous de la transition vitreuse mais pour des vitesses lentes de deformation, des phenomenes de relaxation sensibles a la pression hydrostatique vont se produire autour des bandes de cisaillement de la phase amorphe vitreuse et la recouvrance des deformations va etre retardee. Au dessus de la temperature de transition vitreuse, la deformation de la phase amorphe caoutchoutique s'effectue par diffusion sans engendrer aucune variation de volume ni subir aucune influence de la pression hydrostatique.

Experiments were performed using these techniques, and it is shown that large variations in local strain rate occur while necking and cold-drawing take place. A new tensile testing method is described in which the samples are tested atconstant local true strain rate. This technique is based on the use of a diameter transducer, an exponential voltage generator and a closed-loop testing machine. Flow curves for poly(vinyl chloride) and high density polyethylene were determined at room temperature over the strain rate range of 10−1 to 10−4 sec−1. It is shown that the flow behaviour of these two polymers can be approximated by the constitutive relation:\$\${\textbackslash}sigma  = K {\textbackslash}cdot {\textbackslash}exp [({\textbackslash}gamma \_ {\textbackslash}in  /2) {\textbackslash}in {\textasciicircum}2 ] {\textbackslash}cdot {\textbackslash}dot  {\textbackslash}in {\textasciicircum}m\$\$, whereK andγ∈are constants andm, the rate sensitivity, is in the range 0.02 to 0.06. It is concluded that the positive curvature of the log σ flow curve is responsible for the stabilization of flow localization associated with cold drawing, and that the rate sensitivity plays a much smaller role.},

	abstract = {The large strain deformation response of amorphous polymers results primarily from orientation of the molecular chains within the polymeric material during plastic straining. Molecular network orientation is a highly anisotropic process, thus the observed mechanical response is strongly a function of the anisotropic state of these materials. Through mechanical testing and material characterization, the nature of the evolution of molecular orientation under different conditions of state of strain is developed. The role of developing anisotropy on the mechanical response of these materials is discussed in the context of assessing the capabilities of several models to predict the state of deformation-dependent response. A three-dimensional rubber elasticity spring system that is capable of capturing the state of deformation dependence of strain hardening is used to develop a tensorial internal state variable model of the evolving anisotropic polymer response. This fully three-dimensional constitutive model is shown to be successfully predictive of the true stress vs. true strain data obtained in our isothermal uniaxial compression and plane strain compression experiments on amorphous polycarbonate (PC) and polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) at moderate strain rates. A basis is established for providing the polymer designer with the ability to predict the flow strengths and deformation patterns of highly anisotropic materials. A companion paper by Arruda, Boyce, and Quintus-Bosz [in press] shows how the model developed herein is used to predict various anisotropic aspects of the large strain mechanical response of preoriented materials. Additional work has been done to extend the model to include the effects of strain rate and temperature in Arruda, Jayachandran, and Boyce [in press].},

The experiments were conducted isothermally at 84 °C, which is in the glass transition region, and at 90 °C, above Tg. The stress-strain behaviour is qualitatively different at the two temperatures. At the lower temperature, there is an initial stiff response followed by a decrease in slope suggestive of yielding, whereas this effect is absent at 90 °C. There is strain rate dependence at both temperatures, with stress simply related to the logarithm of the shear rate. To model the behaviour above the glass transition, strain rate dependence is included in a network model; the alternative of a time independent network acting in parallel with a yielding process is found to be inadequate. At the lower temperature, however, there is a need for such a process acting in parallel with the time dependent network in order to predict adequately the initial shapes of the stress-strain curves. The resulting constitutive equations provide very good representations at both temperatures.},

	abstract = {The constitutive behaviour of amorphous polymers near the glass transition contains many features general to this class of materials. A new, physically based, three-dimensional constitutive model has been developed for simulating this wide range of features in models of polymer products and processes. In particular, the model displays glassy response at low temperatures and short time-scales, and rubber-like response at high temperatures and long time-scales, and is therefore an example of a glass-rubber constitutive model. Its basis is the assumed additivity of free energies of bond distortion and conformation perturbation. For the elastic bond distortion stress-strain law and flow model, and the conformational entropy function, the model employs linear elasticity, Eyring viscous flow and the Edwards-Vilgis entropy function, respectively. Glass structure and temperature dependence are introduced through the Vogel-Tammann-Fulcher and Arrhenius equations for viscosity, respectively. With parameters obtained for poly(ethylene terephthalate) in a companion paper, the model was solved numerically to simulate a variety of uniaxial strain sequences, and found to replicate well the characteristic patterns of behaviour of amorphous polymers in the temperature region of interest, over a wide range of experimental situations from small to large strains. The only major deficiency, resulting from the simplifying assumption of a single activation barrier height, is its being too localized in the time domain. At high temperatures and long times, applicability of the model is limited by the onset of conformational relaxation.},

	abstract = {Three-dimensional molecular network theories are studied which use a non-Gaussian statistical mechanics model for the large strain extension of molecules. Invoking an affine deformation assumption, the evolution of the network — consisting of a large number of molecular chains per unit volume, which are initially randomly oriented in space — is shown to be governed by a balance equation in orientation space. Eulerian and Lagrangian type formulations of these balance equations are given, and the closed-form analytical solution for the so-called Chain Orientation Distribution Function is derived. This full network model is then used to describe the large strain inelastic behaviour of rubber-like materials. Detailed comparisons with experimental results and with two approximate models, namely the classical three-chain model and a very recently proposed eight-chain model, are provided for different types of deformation and rubbers. Finally, the network model is applied to describe the orientational hardening in amorphous glassy polymers, and confronted with experimental data for polycarbonate. The inherent physical limitations of the network theory for both applications are discussed.},

	abstract = {A study was made of yield and plastic flow in glassy polystyrene. A range of 12 linear atactic polystyrenes was studied: monodisperse, bimodal blends, and a polydisperse commercial sample. Mn varied between 66,000 and 490,000 g/mol. These were given standardized thermal treatments and then subjected to uniaxial compression tests in the glassy state over the temperature range 40 to 95 °C and nominal strain-rates 10−4 to 10−3 s−1. Their constitutive responses were interpreted in terms of the physically based three-dimensional constitutive model for small or large deformations in amorphous polymers proposed earlier (Polymer 1995, 36, 3301–3312), including plastic strain-induced structural rejuvenation. In multimode form, the model captured closely both linear viscoelastic response and yield and plastic flow. When the reduction of Vogel temperature caused by chain ends was incorporated in the model, it predicted a fall in yield stress with reducing molecular length. This was also observed in experimental data, with the rate of fall approximately in agreement. The results provide further support for the model as a unifying framework for describing the physical properties of polymer glasses. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

	abstract = {Creep age forming (CAF) is an advanced forming technology that combines creep deformation and age hardening processes. When compared with the conventional forming technologies including roll bending and shot-peen forming, CAF has many advantages of low residual stress, excellent dimensional stability, good service performance and short production cycle. It is an optimal technique for precise manufacturing for shape and properties of large-scale complicated thin-walled components of light-weight and high strength aluminum alloys in the aviation and aerospace industries. Nevertheless, CAF has an inevitable disadvantage that a large amount of springback occurs after unloading, which brings a challenge on the accurate shape forming and property tailoring of components. Therefore, how to achieve accurate prediction and control of springback has always been a bottleneck hindering the development of CAF to more industrial applications. After the factors of affecting springback and measures of reducing springback are summarized from the internal and external aspects, constitutive models for predicting springback and springback compensation methods for CAF of aluminum alloy panel components are reviewed. Then, a review of research progresses on tool design for CAF is presented. Finally, in view of the key issue that it is difficult to predict and control the shape and properties of components during CAF, the technical challenges are discussed and future development trends of CAF are prospected.
A new practical modeling of the Norton's power law creep is proposed and implemented to analyze the high temperature behaviors of Alloy 690 SG tube material. In the model, both the stress exponent n and the rate constant B are simply treated as the temperature dependent parameters. Based on the two-step optimization procedure, the temperature function of the rate constant B(T) was determined for the data set of each B value after fixing the stress exponent n value by using the prior optimized function at each temperature. This procedure could significantly reduce the numerical errors when using the power law creep equations. Based on the better description of the steady-state creep rates, the experimental rupture times could also be well predicted by using the Monkman-Grant relationship. Furthermore, the difference in tensile strengths at high temperatures could be very well estimated by assuming the imaginary creep stress related to the given strain rate after correcting the temperature effects on the elastic modulus.
A phenomenological analysis for predicting the long-term creep life of high temperature materials at different temperatures using model parameters derived from short-term creep tests is presented. The model invokes Maxwell-Boltzmann temperature dependence, as rigorously developed in a recent analysis pertaining to the power law domain and a modified form of the Monkman-Grant hypothesis for isothermal conditions. In addition, the model provides, by pattern recognition, suitable weighting factors for the role of strain rate and temperature. The result is a material-dependent analysis which uses only short-term creep test data but is able to predict accurately both the short- and long-term creep behaviour of several complex creep-resistant alloys. This analysis is validated using reliable and accurate creep data taken from NIMS (National Institute of Materials Science, Japan) database pertaining to 10 industrial, high temperature alloys. The consistency or otherwise of the predictions is examined and the importance of the weighting factors in ensuring accurate predictions is emphasized.
Titanium and its alloys are extensively used in a variety of high performance applications with the α + β alloy, Ti-6Al-4V, being the most popular. Conventionally Ti alloys in the as-cast condition possess highly coarse prior β grains, whose size is in the order of {\textasciitilde}mm. Such large grain sizes not only reduce the strength of the alloy, but also impair its workability. The addition of about 0.1\% wt.\% B can result marked reduction in the grain size. The advantages offered by microstructural refinements, thus induced by trace addition of B in Ti alloys, are reviewed in this paper. Processing response of the as-cast alloys improved as a result of grain refinement due to B addition, leading to the possibility of removal or minimization of primary ingot breakdown steps. This can significantly bring down the cost of the finished Ti alloys components. Microstructural refinements with B addition on the mechanical performance of the alloys both at room and elevated temperatures are reviewed with emphasis on the microstructure-property correlations.
Hydrogen embrittlement (HE) substantially deteriorates the mechanical properties of metals. The HE behavior of nanograined (NG) materials with a high fraction of grain boundaries (GBs) may significantly differ from those of their coarse-grained counterparts. Herein, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed to investigate the HE behavior and mechanism of NG α-Fe under creep loading. The effects of temperature, sustained stress, and grain size on the creep mechanism was examined based on the Mukherjee-Bird-Dorn (MBD) equation. The deformation mechanisms were found to be highly dependent on temperature, applied stress, and grain size. Hydrogen charging was found to have an inhibitory effect on the GB-related deformation mechanism. As the grain size increased, the HE mechanism transitioned from H-induced inhibition of GB-related deformation to H-enhanced GB decohesion. The current results might provide theoretical guidance for designing NG structural materials with low HE sensitivity and better mechanical performance.
Creep is an inevitable problem in the design and maintenance of modern high-temperature machinery. Accurate understanding of the mechanism and law of material creep failure is the basis of structural creep performance evaluation. The microstructure of GH4169 alloy after creep at 873.15 K and 923.15 K was analyzed by OM, SEM, EBSD and EDS. In addition, the effect of different grain sizes on the creep behavior of the material and the ability of the phenomenological model to describe the creep curve are also discussed. The results show that there are inclusions formed by Nb and Ti inside the alloy, and local stress concentration is caused during the creep deformation and crack propagation, which leads to the initiation of microcracks or voids. The microstructure of the material before the third stage of creep or far away from the creep fracture is not much different from the original material. The initiation and propagation of cracks and crystal slip mainly occur near the fracture surface. During the creep process, oxygen will combine with aluminum element on the surface of the material to form an alumina layer, and cracks are mainly initiated at the interface between the oxide layer and the matrix. When the crack penetrates the oxide layer, oxide particles will be formed on the grain boundary. The grain size studied in this paper have little effect on the creep strain and rate curves. The results of grain refinement are mainly reflected in the slight increase of creep fracture strain and life. The constitutive model used according to the creep failure process of the material can describe the whole creep curve.
The primary components in pressurised water reactors are manufactured by welding thick sections of either SA508 or SA533 pressure vessel steel using processes such as submerged arc welding (SAW) or gas-tungsten arc welding (GTAW). Narrow-groove (NG) variants of these processes have reduced welding times, but thick-section welds still require a large number of passes. In this work, the effects of a large number of welding thermal cycles on the through-thickness variability in microstructure and mechanical properties have been analysed for NG-GTAW and NG-SAW joints made in 78 mm thick SA533 steel. Microstructures were characterised using optical and scanning electron microscopy, while mechanical properties were captured in cross-weld tensile tests using digital image correlation and through tests on coupons extracted exclusively from the weld metal and from the heat-affected zone. Charpy impact testing was used to assess toughness. While the toughness was relatively consistent throughout the SAW joint, significant through-thickness variations in toughness were observed in the NG-GTAW joint, which can be attributed to the varying degree to which the weldment was tempered by subsequent welding thermal cycles.
Hydrogen trapping at metal/carbide interfaces is changed with changing interfacial composition. This has been exemplified for the iron/vanadium carbide (VC) interface. It will be assumed that the carbide interface is a (100)-plane having a composition between the limiting cases of either 50\% V and 50\% C for excess carbon in iron or 50\% V and 50\% carbon-vacancies for excess vanadium in iron. The latter will provide strong traps for hydrogen. For validating the simple model a modified interpretation of published atom probe and thermal desorption data became necessary as discussed in the present work.
Accurate tritium transport properties of prospective tritium permeation barriers (TPBs) are essential to tritium systems in fusion reactors. By passing a temperature and rate-controlled sweeping gas over specimen surfaces to carry the permeated tritium to an ion chamber, the gas-driven permeation of tritium has been performed on 321 type stainless steel containers with Al2O3/FeAl barriers, to determine the T-permeation resistant performance and mechanism of the barrier. The tritium permeability of the Al2O3/FeAl coated container was reduced by 3 orders of magnitude at 500–700 °C by contrast with that of the bare one, which meets the requirement of the tritium permeation reduction factor (PRF) of TPBs for tritium operating components in the CN-HCCB TBM. The Al2O3/FeAl barrier resists the tritium permeation by the diffusion in the bulk substrate at a limited number of defect sites with an effective area and thickness, suggesting that the TPB quality is a very important factor for efficient T-permeation resistance.
Ferritic creep-resistant steel, according to ASME Code case Grade 92 (Gr.92), contains 9\%Cr (chromium). It has a high creep rupture strength at 600°C for 100 000 h, and is therefore a suitable material for long-term use in a high-temperature and pressure steam circulating coal-fired power plant. The mechanical, physical and creep properties are introduced and explained in this chapter. Creep strength prognostication, and its optimization through experimentally designed chemical composition, is covered and the field test records are also explained.
The landscape of energy production and use is facing great challenges in the transportation sectors. The two main means of transportation, automobiles and airplanes, are mainly made from metals. The necessity of reducing their carbon emission translates into major stakes for weight reduction, which can only be the result of an interplay between improving the alloys and the part's geometry. This contribution discusses some of the strategies for structural weight reduction based on innovative alloy design in aluminum alloys and steels and on innovative processing by additive manufacturing.
Le paysage de la production d'énergie et de son utilisation est confronté à des défis importants dans le secteur des transports. Les deux principaux moyens de transport, automobile et aérien, sont principalement fabriqués avec des métaux. La nécessité de réduire leurs émissions de CO2 se traduit par une exigence majeure d'allègement, qui ne peut résulter que d'une action conjuguée d'amélioration des alliages et de la géométrie des pièces. Cette contribution discute certaines des stratégies pour l'allègement des structures basées sur la conception innovante d'alliages d'aluminium et d'aciers et sur les procédés innovants par fabrication additive.
The microstructure evolution and carbide precipitation in a Ti-46Al-8Nb-0.7C alloy as well as its creep properties at intermediate temperatures are investigated by high-energy X-ray diffraction and electron microscopy. The alloy with a nearly fully lamellar microstructure exhibits excellent creep resistance, which could be attributed to the good microstructural stability and strengthening effects from both P- and H-carbides. It is also found that the creep parameters have different effects on the precipitation of the carbides. The overall volume fraction of the carbides shows a positive correlation with the creep temperature and time. However, the thermal stability of P-carbides in the γ grain interior decreases at a higher creep temperature. The creep stress hardly affects the precipitation and morphology development of the P-carbides. On the contrary, a higher stress can promote the H-carbide formation at the γ/α2 interfaces via α2 lath decomposition in lamellar colonies.},

A raft made of a randomized mixture of two different sizes of bubbles in roughly equal numbers has many structural characteristics of a metallic glass and can serve as a quantitatively accurate analog for it. The two-dimensional pair distribution function of such a raft resembles those in glassy metals. In addition this structure permits a simple definition of free area as a two-dimensional analog of free volume and the accurate determination of its distribution. When sheared the rafts are observed to change shape by a collection of very local shear transformations. These transformations are in the nature of either relatively equiaxed regions of about 5 bubble diameters undergoing complex internal rearrangements or are in the form of two-dimensional slip patches involving sharp shear translations of two adjacent nearly close packed bubble rows that are about 5 bubbles in length. These observations lead by analogy to the postulate that in metallic glasses the corresponding three-dimensional processes are also shear transformations in correspondingly small volume elements. These are either in the form of equiaxed regions undergoing some redundant internal rearrangements of atoms imposed by the specific disordered structure or are in the form of very narrow pennyshaped shear transformations resembling dislocation loops.},

	abstract = {Glassy polymers are extensively used as high impact resistant, low density, and clear materials in industries. Due to the lack of the long-range order in the microstructures of glassy solids, plastic deformation is different from that in crystalline solids. Shear transformation zones (STZs) are believed to be the plasticity carriers in amorphous solids and defined as the localized atomic or molecular deformation patches induced by shear. Despite a great effort in characterizing these local disturbance regions in metallic glasses (MGs), there are still many unknowns relating to the microstructural and micromechanical characteristics of STZs in glassy polymers. This chapter is aimed at investigating the flow phenomenon in polycarbonate (PC) and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) as glassy polymers and obtaining the mechanical and geometrical characteristics of their STZs. To achieve this goal, the nanoindentation experiments are performed on samples with two different thermal histories: as-cast and annealed, and temperature and strain rate dependency of the yield stress of PC and PMMA are studied. Based on the experimental results, it is showed that the flow in PC and PMMA is a homogeneous phenomenon at tested temperatures and strain rates. The homogeneous flow theory is then applied to analyze the STZs quantitatively. The achieved results are discussed for their possible uniqueness or applicability to all glassy polymers in the context of amorphous plasticity.},

On introduit une carte empirique de la déformation des verres métalliques et l'on passe en revue les deux modes de déformation, l'écoulement homogène et l'écoulement hétérogène. Le mécanisme microscopique de l'écoulement hétérogène en régime permanent repose sur un équilibre dynamique entre la création produite par la contrainte et l'annihilation par diffusion du désordre structural. On utilise un formalisme dans lequel le volume libre est considéré comme paramètre d'ordre. On calcule dans la carte de la déformation la ligne de séparation des régions d'écoulement homogène et hétérogène. Les relations contrainte-déformation en écoulement hétérogène sont proches du comportement idéalement plastique.
Zusammenfassung
Eine empirische Verformungskarte wird für metallische Gläser eingeführt; zwei Arten der Verformung, homogenes und inhomogenes Flieβen, werden besprochen. Der mikroskopische Mechanismus des stationären inhomogenen Flieβens baut auf einem dynamischen Gleichgewicht zwischen spannungsgetriebener Erzeugung der strukturellen Unordnung und ihrer Annihilation durch Diffusion auf. Der Formalismus wird mit der freien Energie als Ordnungsparameter entwickelt Die Grenzlinie zwischen Gebieten homogenen und inhomogenen Flieβens in der Verformungskarte wird berechnet. Die Spannungs-Dehnungsbeziehung bei inhomogenem Flieβen kommt ideal plastischem Verhalten nahe.},

	abstract = {Internal structures (microstructures) appear in solids at different length scales. Generally speaking, their influence on the macromotion can be understood and measured on the macrolevel. However, “there is no unique answer to the question how the microstructure influence can be accounted for in a continuum mechanical model” [132]. In addition, thermodynamical constraints should be taken into account, which is not obvious in many theories. In the previous section, heterogeneity is linked to the real microstructure, like “cells” in the Mindlin theory. One possibility to bring thermodynamics directly into modelling of dynamical phenomena is provided by the concept of internal variables. The idea of internal variables can be traced back to P. Duhem, P. Bridgman and J. Kestin (see historical overview in [161]). A contemporary presentation of the formalism of internal variables is presented by Maugin [154] and Maugin and Muschik [163].},

	abstract = {The constitutive modelling of semi-crystalline polymers (SCP) has to consider several aspects as rate- and temperature-dependence, self-heating, and in particular, the double yield (DY) phenomenon. A full characterization of all these complex features involves prominent efforts in terms of material testing and parameter identification (PI). The contribution of the crystalline phase plays an important role in the evolution of the plastic yield in the SCPs. In this work, a constitutive model, named Unified SCP (USCP), is proposed by modifying the physically-based Boyce–Parks–Argon (BPA) glassy model. The contribution of the crystalline phase is introduced in the strain softening/hardening evolution law of the strength, providing an alternative interpretation of the underlying morphological changes caused by the crystalline phase embedded in the amorphous phase. The proposed formulation extends the BPA model with a new contribution to capture the crystalline phase. A full thermo-mechanical coupled numerical framework is developed for the USCP model validation. The DY phenomenon at different strain rates with self-heating and thermal softening effects is investigated and predicted. The proposed model extension needs three material constants with clear physical meaning. To identify them, a fast in-house optimization process based on Nelder–Mead is used, in which only a single element test is required. The model accurately predicts the experimental results for both thermosets and thermoplastics such as epoxy, nylon 101, PA6 and LDPE under monotonic loadings reported by different authors.},

	abstract = {The double yield (DY) phenomenon observed in a wide variety of semi-crystalline polymers (SCP) adds difficulties in the material characterization. In this paper, a constitutive model, termed as explicit semi-crystalline polymer (ESCP) model, is proposed to study DY phenomenon as well as the rate- and temperature-dependent thermomechanical response below the glass transition temperature. The underlying yield kinetics due to the morphological changes of the spherulite micro-structure is represented by a rheological analogue described by a physicallybased amorphous intermolecular resistance and a rate-independent crystalline interlamellar resistance. Independently-identified viscoelastic response and network resistance are also implemented to complete the model description. The activation and disclosure of the crystalline component depend on the saturated state of amorphous phase. The proposed model is validated against experimental data obtained from different authors for three commonly used SCPs: nylon 101, LDPE and PA6. A straightforward parameter identification procedure, requiring a minimum number of calibration tests, is presented to illustrate the model usage. The thermomechanical-coupled analyses provide satisfactory predictions using simulated models of a cylinder compression and dogbone tensile tests at different rates, where the self-heating and thermal softening effects are naturally captured by the model.},
