\chapter{Numerical results} \label{sec:numerical_results}

This chapter presents two sets of results concerning the subject of thermomechanical modeling of semi-crystalline polymers.
The first is adapted from \cite{vila-chaNumericalAssessmentPartitioned2023a} and pertains to the implicit partitioned solution of the thermomechanical model employing a elasto-plastic description for the material.
The second pertains to the implementation and validation of state of the art constitutive models for semi-crystalline polymers.

\section{Necking of a thermoelastoplastic circular bar}
     \label{sec:mech-driv-probl}

     The thermomemechanical problem under analysis consists of the thermally triggered necking of a circular bar, as initially reported in \cite{simo_associative_1992} and replicated in \cite{danowski_computational_2014}.
     The problem consists of a cylindrical bar of radius $r=\SI{6.413}{\milli\meter}$ and length $h=\SI{53.334}{\milli\meter}$ subject to a prescribed axial displacement $\bar{u}_{y}=\SI{8}{\milli\meter}$ at both ends during $t_s=\SI{8}{\second}$.
     The supports at the tips allow the contraction of the specimen.
     The bar is initially at room $T_{0}=T_{\infty}=\SI{293}{\kelvin}$ and is subject to heat transfer by convection at all boundaries, with a heat transfer coefficient $h_{c} = \SI{17.5e-3}{\newton\milli\meter^{-1}\second^{-1}\kelvin^{-1}}$.
     The material is modeled by the constitutive model proposed by Simo and Miehe \citep{simo_associative_1992}, and the material properties are given in Table~\ref{tab:matpropsnecking}.

     The problem is analyzed using two-dimensional axisymmetric QUAD4-FBAR elements \citep{de_souza_neto_design_1996} for the mechanical problem and QUAD4 elements for the thermal problem.
     Figure~\ref{fig:necking} illustrates the problem setup, the finite element mesh employed in the 2D simulations, and distinct stages of deformation and temperature field during the prescribed elongation, evidencing the significant necking of the bar.

       \label{fig:necking}
     \end{figure}
     %
     Only one-quarter of the specimen is simulated, resulting in a finite element mesh with 1326 nodes and 1250 elements.
     Unless otherwise stated, this mesh is employed in the following analyses.
     The load is applied in a total of 80 equal magnitude increments and considering a constant incremental time step of \(\Delta t = \SI{0.1}{\second}\).
     A quasi-static solution is computed for the mechanical problem using a backward Euler integration. The transient temperature field is integrated with the generalised-$\alpha$ method with $\rho_{\infty, T}=1.0$.

     \subsubsection{Validation of the numerical results}

     The reaction force at the supports and the neck surface temperature at point A are compared to results found in the literature to validate the computationally implemented solution procedure, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:necking}.
     The analysis's reference data may be found in \cite{simo_associative_1992}.
     It should be noted that key distinctions between the current work and the reference lead to slightly different outcomes.
     Regarding the heat conduction law employed in each contribution, although the large deformation version of the Fourier law is adopted in both works, Simo and Miehe \citep{simo_associative_1992} considered the spatial thermal conductivity, $k$, as a fixed material parameter.
     In the present work, the material thermal conductivity, $k_{0}$, is interpreted as the fixed material parameter.
     In addition, Simo and Miehe \citep{simo_associative_1992} solved the coupled problem using an explicit scheme, while in the present work, an implicit schemes is considered.
     Lastly, regarding  spatial discretisation, Simo and Miehe \citep{simo_associative_1992} employed mixed displacement-pressure QUAD8 elements.

     The evolution of the reaction force and the neck surface temperature as a function of the prescribed displacement are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:necking_force_temperature_coupled_quad4fbar}.
     \begin{figure}[!hbtp]
       \centering
       \includegraphics[width=.85\textwidth]{necking_force_temperature_coupled_quad4fbar}
       \caption{Evolution of the reaction force at the tips of the bar and the neck surface temperature with the prescribed displacement using QUAD4-FBAR elements for the mechanical problem and QUAD4 elements for the thermal problem.}
       \label{fig:necking_force_temperature_coupled_quad4fbar}
     \end{figure}
     %
     From a physical point of view, the reaction forces show that the simulation occurs almost entirely in the elastoplastic regime.
     As previously mentioned, necking is automatically triggered, resulting in a significant reduction of the reaction force starting at approximately $\bar{u}_{y}=\SI{4}{\milli\meter}$, followed by a steep temperature rise due to the higher plastic dissipation around the necking region.

     Inspecting Figure~\ref{fig:necking_force_temperature_coupled_quad4fbar} from a validation perspective, the numerical results show a reasonable agreement with the literature.
     Regarding the reaction force at the supports, there is a good agreement for most of the displacement range examined, except for the largest values, where some discrepancy is be observed.
     There are larger disparities in the neck surface temperature at point A, with noticeable differences for displacements larger than \(\bar{u}_y\approx\SI{3.5}{\milli\meter}\).
     However, the differences previously mentioned between the modeling approaches adopted in the present work and in \cite{simo_associative_1992} offer sufficient justification for the differences observed.

     \subsubsection{Comparison of implicit solution methods}

     In this section, appropriate implicit methods for solving thermomechanical problems with thermoplastic constitutive behavior are compared.
     These are the fixed-point method, the Aitken relaxation method, two Broyden-like methods, both Type I, with $\beta=-1$ and $s=1$ (coinciding with Broyden's method) or $s=2$, a Newtonâ€“GMRES method, and MPE method in cycling mode with $p=1$ and $q=3$.
     The maximum displacement at both ends is restricted to \SI{5}{\milli\meter}, applied in \SI{5}{\second} in 100 increments (\(\Delta t = \SI{0.05}{\second}\)) to prevent an excessive elongation of the elements in the finite element simulation.
     The coupling strength is correlated with the value of thermal softening parameters \(w_0\) and \(w_h\), set to be equal.
     Its effect on the implicit solution of the problem is an increased number of nonlinear iterations to solve the problem, as is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:necking_single_iter_diff_w_0_n_iter_time_quad4fbar_pred}.
     It depicts the number of nonlinear iterations needed to solve the coupled problem at each time step and the corresponding total number of residual evaluations as a function of the thermal expansion coefficient for the fixed-point method in the solution of the necking of a circular bar with \(w_0=w_h\in\{\SI{2e-3}{},\, \SI{4.89e-3}{},\, \SI{1e-2}{}\}\,\si{\kelvin^{-1}}\).
     A higher total number of nonlinear iterations per time step is necessary to solve the problem as \(w_0\) and \(w_h\) increase, corresponding to a taller and broader peak in the number of iterations needed to solve the problem per time step.
     The coupling strength is the most intense when the necking begins, which occurs at different moments as \(w_0\) and \(w_h\) vary.
     This peak is the main contributor to the difference in the total number of iterations taken to solve each problem with different softening parameters.
     Once again, the improvement in the efficiency achieved by the implicit methods under analysis is obtained by decreasing the number of nonlinear iterations needed to solve the problem when the coupling is the most challenging, as can be concluded from Figure~\ref{fig:necking_comparison_best_n_iter_time_quad4fbar_pred}.
     It shows the number of nonlinear iterations needed to solve the coupled problem at each time step and the total number of residual evaluations as a function of the thermal expansion coefficient for several implicit methods in the solution of the necking of a circular bar with \(w_0=w_h=\SI{1e-2}{\kelvin^{-1}}\).
     On the other hand, when the coupling is not as demanding, the difference between the different methods is hardly noticeable.

       \label{fig:necking_single_iter_diff_w_0_n_iter_time_quad4fbar_pred}
     \end{figure}

     \begin{figure}[!hbtp]

       \label{fig:necking_comparison_best_n_iter_time_quad4fbar_pred}
     \end{figure}


     It is pointed out that what is depticted in Figures~\ref{fig:necking_single_iter_diff_w_0_n_iter_time_quad4fbar_pred} and \ref{fig:necking_comparison_best_n_iter_time_quad4fbar_pred} is the number of nonlinear and not the number of residual evaluation per time step.
     Thus, for comparisons concerning the computational efficiency of the different methods under analysis, the information shown in
     Figure~\ref{fig:necking_comparison_best_cpu_time_n_iter_coupl_strength_quad4fbar_pred} is more appropriate, as it displays the total CPU time in seconds and the total number of residual evaluations as a function of the thermal softening parameters.
     The best performing methods are the Broyden-like methods, whose performance is very similar.
     They are followed by the Aitken relaxation and the MPE in cycling mode, also displaying a comparable efficiency.
     The Newton-GMRES method is the worse performing method considered, being around 20\% slower than the Broyden-like methods and roughly on par with the fixed-point method.
     Moreover, it fails to converge for \(w_0=w_h=\SI{2e-3}{\kelvin^{-1}}\).
     Table~\ref{tab:necking_res_cpu_nr_func_best} summarizes all the results previously discussed regarding the computational time each implicit method takes and the number of residual evaluations.

     % \subsubsection{Effect of predictors}
     %
     % Figure~\ref{fig:necking_comparison_best_pred_total_iters_coupl_strength_quad4fbar_pred} presents the effect of employing a linear or quadratic predictor on the number of residual evaluations needed to fully solve the thermomechanical problem under analysis as a function of the softening parameters.
     % All methods improve using the polynomial predictors, with the best effects being achieved using the quadratic predictor.
     % The decrease in residual evaluations is around 30\% for all methods using the quadratic predictor at \(w_0=w_h=\SI{1e-2}{\kelvin^{-1}}\) corresponding to the strongest coupling, except for the MPE.
     % The polynomial vector extrapolation method displays a much smaller increase in efficiency from the polynomial predictors considered.
     % This is again because using a predictor the problem is solved at most time steps in a single nonlinear iterations, requiring each five residual evaluations.
     % Thus 100 increments lead to 500 residual evalutions for the whole simulation if each time step is solved in a single nonlinear iteration.
     % Further considerations previously mentioned in Section~\ref{sec:effect_pred_thick} also apply.
     % Finally, the use of predictors allows the Newton-GMRES method to converge for \(w_0=w_h=\SI{2e-3}{\kelvin^{-1}}\).

\section{State of the art in semi-crystalline polymer modeling}

This section analyses two state-of-the-art constitutive models for semi-crystalline polymers.
The first model is described in \cite{haoUnifiedAmorphousCrystalline2022} aand is applicable to polymer plastics in general, without explicitly considering the polymer's bulk crystallinity.
Alternatively, the second model can be found in \cite{abdul-hameedTwophaseHyperelasticviscoplasticConstitutive2014} and considers the crystallinity of the polymer explicitly, attempting to describe the polymer at different cyrstallinities with only one set of material parameters.
The main features of each model are described throughout Chatper~\ref{ch:modeling_semi_crystalline_polymer}.

\paragraph{Computational framework}
The solution of the thermomechanical problem is achieved employing an approach described thorougly in \cite{bergstromMechanicsSolidPolymers2015} and \cite{alvesFastOptimizationbasedParameter2022}, whose \verb|Python| implementation is available in-house.
It is restrcited to displacement-driven uniaxial loading, traction or compression, and it achieves the solution of the mechanical problem through a minimization procedure.
In each time step the axial stretch is prescribed and the transversal stretches are obtained as those leading to a minimum in the transversal stresses.
This minimum should be zero as the boundary condition on the laterial surfaces corresponds to a free surface.
Accordingly, it is implicitly assumed that the response is homogeneous, which allows for comparisons solely with experimental results where the intrinsic response of the material is shown.

\paragraph{Inclusion of the thermal}
Regarding the thermal field, its inclusion is restricted to the isothermic and adiabatic cases.
The former coincides with a strain rate sufficiently slow so that the heat generated from the deformation is easily offloaded to the environment, keeping the temperature constant.
The latter corresponds to a strain rate so fast that no energy is exchanged with the environment during loading, approaching an adiabatic condition.
Arruda et al. \citep{arrudaEffectsStrainRate1995} employ the dimensionless number defined as $\tau_\text{therm} = t_\text{test}/t_d$ to probe how appropriate either of these assumptions is.
$t_\text{test}$ is defined as the test time to reach the true strain of $-1.0$ (in compression), and $t_d$ is thermal diffusion time of the speciment, which may be approximated as
\begin{equation}
  t_d \approx \frac{L^2}{2(k/\rho C_\mathbf{F})},
\end{equation}
where $L$ is a characteristic dimension of the specimen from the center of the deforming region to the nearest heat sink.
If $\tau_\text{therm} \ll 1$, it is safe to assume an adiabatic evolution, however if $\tau_\text{therm}\gg 1$, the experiment progresses isothermically.
$\tau_\text{therm}\approx 1$ points to  a coupled problem, in the sense that some heat is removed from the specimen as the experiment progresses, without however preventing an increase in temperature.

In the present work, an adiabatic evolution is achieved through the inclusion of the temperature as an internal variable of the model, whose rate equation is the heat conduction equation (see Equation~\eqref{eq:heat_conduction}), discarding the heat conduction term and setting the internal dissipation according to the constitutive model prescribed.
On the other hand, to ensure an isothermic evolution, the temperature is treated as a model parameter and remains constant throughout the simulation.

\subsection{\cite{haoUnifiedAmorphousCrystalline2022}}

Following the description in \cite{haoUnifiedAmorphousCrystalline2022}, the experimental results employed for validation are those of Khan and Farrokh \citep{khanThermomechanicalResponseNylon2006} obtained during the uniaxial compression of nylon 101 at a constant strain rate.
The material is modeled by the constitutive model proposed by Hao et al. \citep{haoUnifiedAmorphousCrystalline2022}, and the material properties are given in Table~\ref{tab:mat_prop_hao}.
They are taken from \cite{haoUnifiedAmorphousCrystalline2022}, with the exception of the parameter $m$ whose value is taken as \num{0.66}, following \cite{haoRatedependentConstitutiveModel2022}, as the supplied value in the first contribution, \num{0.8}, did not produce the expected results.

The strain rates considered are \SIlist{1e-5;1e-2;1e0}{\per\second}.
The first corresponds to an adiabatic process and the last to and isothermic process, as evaluated by the dimensionless parameter $\tau_\text{therm}$ \citep{haoUnifiedAmorphousCrystalline2022}.
A strain rate of \SI{1e-2}{\per\second} coincides, however, with a coupled evolution, which is neither adiabatic nor isothermic.
Despite this, due to the constraints on the computational tool available, it is simulated here using an adabatic condition.
The stress-strain and temperature-strain curves obtained are compared in Figure~\ref{fig:stress_temp_strain_hao_results} to the experimental results in \cite{khanThermomechanicalResponseNylon2006} and the numerical results obtained by Hao et al. \citep{haoUnifiedAmorphousCrystalline2022}.

In \cite{haoUnifiedAmorphousCrystalline2022}, the authors mention that the activation plastic strain may vary with the temperature and the strain rate, in addition to other variables.
They do not, however, establish a specific relation between this parameter and the strain rate for nylon 101.
The value corresponding to $\varepsilon=\SI{1e-5}{\per\second}$ is given in Table~\ref{tab:mat_prop_hao} and found in \cite{haoUnifiedAmorphousCrystalline2022}, while the values employed for the other two strain rates are taken from \cite{haoRatedependentConstitutiveModel2022} where the same experimental data is considered by some of the same authors.
These are $\dot\gamma^{p,2}=\num{0.0577}$ at $\dot\varepsilon = \SI{1e-2}{\per\second}$ and $\dot\gamma^{p,2}=\num{0.0705}$ at $\dot\varepsilon = \SI{1e0}{\per\second}$.

Discussing first the fitness of the model proposed in \cite{haoUnifiedAmorphousCrystalline2022} to describe the experimental results of Khan and Farrokh \citep{khanThermomechanicalResponseNylon2006}, the model captures adequately the elastic range and the first yield point.
This is due to the extended formulation of the rate equation presented by the authors (see Equation~\eqref{eq:rate_equation_hao}) which considers four different athermal strengths related to the yield of the different phases in the polymer.
As seen from the experimental results, nylon 101 displays double yield, which becomes more noticeable as the rain rate increases.
To the point, in Figure~\ref{fig:stress_temp_strain_hao_results}, only the strain rates of \SIlist{1e-2;1e0}{\per\second} show a prominent double yield.
This phenomenon is also correctly described by the model, with a slight underestimation of the stress response for the higher strain rates.
This is achieved through the dependence of the athermal strength on the temperature through the elastic modulus, similar to what is shown in Equation~\eqref{eq:athermal_strength_elasticity_rel}.
Conversely, regarding the second yield stress, the model overestimates the stress slightly.
In fact, the experimental value found for the second yield stress is \SI{129.8}{\mega\pascal}, with the model predicting a value of \SI{134.5}{\mega\pascal}, amounting to a relative error of \num{3.6}\%.

When the numerical results obtained in this work and in \cite{haoUnifiedAmorphousCrystalline2022} are compared, there is perfect agreement for the lowest strain rate considered (\SI{1e-5}{\per\second}).
The same cannot be said for the other two strain rates.
Nonetheless, until the first yield and subsequent softening, there is good agreement between the two sets of numerical results.
\colorbox{BrickRed}{Say something more specific about the features of the model.}
As the strain increases, the difference between the two grows larger.
There are a few reasons for this.
The first concerns mainly the experiment corresponding to a strain rate of \SI{1e-2}{\per\second}, which in the present work is simulated as an adiabatic process.
This is not strictly true and contributes to differences relative to the reference results, which were obtained employing a fully thermomechanical description of the problem including conduction inside the cylinder and converction at its borders.
A further contributing factor, that also affects the response obtained in the present work at \SI{1}{\per\second} is the heterogeneity of the response in \cite{haoUnifiedAmorphousCrystalline2022}.
Despite a homogeneous temperature distribution, the plastic deformation is heterogeneous, breaking the assumptions of the numerical tool employed in this work and further motivating differences in the results obtained.
Finally, concerning the temperature evolution with the strain in the adiabatic cases, it remains constant during the elastic portion of the stress-strain response, and begins to increase after this.
The final value obtained for the \SI{1e0}{\per\second} strain rate is \SI{73.4}{\celsius}, which is close to the value obtained in \cite{haoUnifiedAmorphousCrystalline2022} equal to \SI{71.5}{\celsius}, corresponding to a relative error equal to 2.7\%.
However, the same authors find a heterogeneous temperature distribution for the \SI{1e-2}{\per\second} case, rendering a comparison impossible.

In general, the implementation developed in this work compares favourably with the one found in \cite{haoUnifiedAmorphousCrystalline2022}.

Following the description in \cite{abdul-hameedTwophaseHyperelasticviscoplasticConstitutive2014}, the experimental results employed for validation are those of Ayoub et al. \citep{ayoubEffectsCrystalContent2011} obtained during the uniaxial traction of polyethylene with different degrees of crystallinity at a constant strain rate.

The strain rates considered are \SIlist{1e-4;5e-4;1e-3;5e-3;1e-2}{\per\second}, and are all assumed to correspond to an isothermic evolution.
The stress-strain curves obtained for polyethylenes with crystallinities equal to \SIlist{0.724;0.3;0.15}{}\% are compared in Figure~\ref{fig:stress_strain_abdul_hameed} to the experimental results in \cite{ayoubEffectsCrystalContent2011} and the numerical results obtained by Abdul-Hameed et al. \citep{abdul-hameedTwophaseHyperelasticviscoplasticConstitutive2014}.

To begin, Abdul-Hameed et al.'s model \citep{abdul-hameedTwophaseHyperelasticviscoplasticConstitutive2014} must be assessed for its ability to describe the experimental data in \cite{ayoubEffectsCrystalContent2011}.
It can capture accurately the yield stress for all the crystallinities considered, however without accounting for the smooth transient between the elastic range and the "steady state" plastic flow.
Regarding the hardening it is not captured so well.
This is less so for the ULDPE, and it is only true at large strain ($\varepsilon_{xx}>1$) for HDPE.
The behavior of the LDPE is not well capture from the yielding on.
Thus, the attempt of this model to describe the behavior of polyethylene at different crystallinities employing just one set of material parameters is only moderately successful.
\colorbox{BrickRed}{Say something more specific about the features of the model.}

Turning to the comparison between the numerical results obtained in this work and in \cite{abdul-hameedTwophaseHyperelasticviscoplasticConstitutive2014}.
Despite the limitations of the numerical tool available, a good agreement is expected.
That said employing the parameters supplied in contribution just mentioned the results obtained are not those expected.
A better agreement is found taking the shear modulus $C_c$
Still some minor descrepancies in the hardening behavior simulated can be found in the case of the results concerning the HDPE and the LDPE.
These are somewhat exacerbated, especially for the three larger strain rates considered in the case of ULDPE.
On the other hand, there is full concordance in the elastic response and subsequent yielding between the two sets of numerical results at all crystallinities considered.
This points to some differences in the network branch of the model wher the parameters already mentioned contribute to.
That said, there is an acceptable agreement between the numerical results obtained in the present work and in \cite{abdul-hameedTwophaseHyperelasticviscoplasticConstitutive2014}.
